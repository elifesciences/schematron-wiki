# Production Checklist

## Publisher Review 

Once an author has made all the required revisions to their manuscript, it is signed off and comes back to the production team ready for its publisher review. This stage of the process is to check all revisions made by the author, Exeter, copy-editors and the Crossref system, and to provide a broader check on the article to make sure it is up to standard for publication - this involves validating the XML and reviewing the PDFs. 

## Checks prior to starting 

### Notes 

* Notes can be added by both Production and the content processors. To view these on Kriya 2, click on the article in question on the dashboard, then on the 'messages' tab and then the 'notes' tab, as illustrated below. 
* This is where the Production team can add any pieces of relevant information from their correspondence with the author, and where they can correspond with Exeter. 
* It is important at Publisher Review to check for any notes left previously have received a positive response and the correct action has been taken. 
* Whilst carrying out a Publisher Review, if there are changes to be made they generally should be  communicated to Exeter via a Typesetter Query as opposed to through the notes.

### Emails 

In addition to checking an article’s history in notes, you must also check for any emails associated with it. Search the article reference number, look for the thread marked ‘Author Correspondence’, and check for any issues. If so, you will need to check whether these issues have been actioned. 

### **Press** 

You will also want to check whether the article is marked for press. This will be indicated in the 'custom' section, under the 'document details' and 'info' tabs. As mentioned before, these articles should be prioritised at Publisher Review and the press date noted and inputted in the [**Publication History**](production-checklist.md#publication-history) ****section within the article.

### Linked articles 

Some articles will be linked to other articles, indicating that they might need to be published together. If there is one or more linked article, they will be displayed in the 'related articles' section, under the 'document details' and 'info' tabs. Under 'article type', on the 'Document details' page, you can see what kind of related article it is \('commentary’ means it is an Insight\). The colour of the label indicates its progress through the system. Red means it is not in the system yet, yellow means that it is in progress in the system and green means it has been published. 

![Article with two linked articles ](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-07-14-at-12.19.54.png)

### Prioritising articles 

Articles that should be given priority at publisher review include:

* Press articles for an imminent date 
* Insights 
* Feature content

### Assigning articles 

In order to assign an article to you, click on the relevant article in the 'Publisher Review' column. This will prompt a pop-up, displaying the 'Document details' for that article. You then click on the pen and paper button next to 'Assignee'. 

![Document details page](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-08.33.28.png)

This will generate a drop down menu, displaying the available users. Choose your name from the list. 

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-08.30.43.png)

#### Entering the article 

Once you have assigned an article to yourself, to enter an article click the pen and paper button to the left of the panel. 

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-08.38.49.png)

## Article details checks 

### Title 

* Check that the title makes sense.
* Only italic formatting is allowed.
* Check that it avoids unexplained acronyms. 
* For latin words, the general rule is that genes, bacteria and species such as ‘S. pombe’ should be italicised, and that phrases such as ‘in vivo’ or ‘in vitro’ should not be italicised. However continuity between the title, impact statement and article content is most important, so please check that italics are consistent.
* Check the capitalisation - sentence case?

![Title showing tracked changes to correct capitalisation](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-08.40.27.png)

### Major subject areas

There should be at least one major subject area present. 

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-08.40.34%20%281%29.png)

### Authors 

Open the details for each author individually and conduct the following checks:

* If an author has an ORCID ID, follow the link to ensure that it leads to the correct page \(e.g. one with the same name as given in the manuscript\).
* Check that the name is split correctly: ensure that forenames and surnames are in the correct place, and any surname prefixes such as ‘von’ are in the ‘surname’ box. Initials should go after the first name in the ‘Given name, initials’ box - NOT the ‘Initials:’ field - this second field is just an override for the PDF and is usually left empty.
* If the 'corresponding author' box is ticked, their email address will be included in their details.
* Check that they have at least one affiliation, but do not check the affiliations themselves, this will be done at the next stage.
* Author contributions will be listed here - check that they are formatted correctly and that any free-form contributions at the end are sensibly phrased and are not repetitive.
* If an author contributed equally with another author, they will be linked. If the ‘Equal contributor with’ box is ticked, ensure that another name is tagged with it. 
* Any competing interests that an author may have, e.g. if they work as an editor for eLife or another journal, need to be listed here. If they have ticked the ‘None’ box, ensure that nothing is listed. 

![When you click on an author, a window will pop up displaying the editable items](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-08.25.36.png)

### Affiliations 

Sometimes affiliations need to be split up i.e., if there are two departments listed. A centre, within a department, within an institution, is okay. Two departments within an institution is not. Sometimes, authors belonging to two departments at the same institution will try to merge them into one affiliation, they need to be separated into two distinct affiliations. 

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-08.40.49.png)

### Publication History 

* The received, accepted, PoA \(if relevant\) and preprint dates will be pre-filled from the submission system.
* You don't need to check that these dates are correct at this point, they will be validated when you run the XML through the Schematron validator. Read about this [**here.** ](production-checklist.md#xml)\*\*\*\*
* If the article has not been published as an accepted manuscript and is only going to be published as a version of record \(VoR\), you will need to add a publication date. Use the current date if the article will be published that day, or apply the planned press release date.

![When you click on the &apos;Publication History&apos; button, this pop up is generated](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-10-at-10.57.11.png)

### Funding

All funding received by authors in the process of researching and creating the article needs to be referenced here. Open each funding reference individually in order to check the details. Ideally, we want every funder to be validated against the CrossRef Funder Registry. Validated funders are indicated by a green tick. If it is not validated, try retyping the funder. If this doesn’t work, open the CrossRef Funder Registry spreadsheet \(available to download here\) and check if it is on there. If you still cannot find the funder, then conduct a Google search and attempt to determine whether the funder is an accredited body or not. Sometimes the name may need correcting slightly, or may be translated into English when it is registered in the original language. French affiliations are notoriously difficult to untangle.

Every funder must have at least one author associated with it or the system will throw an error and you will be unable to proceed from this screen. Grant references, however, are optional.

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-09.15.34.png)

![You can click into each funding entry to check the details](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-09.15.41.png)

### Data availability 

The Data availability statement \(DAS\) should ideally be at least one sentence and should end in a full-stop. If there are any GitHub links in the DAS, these may need to be archived. You can find out [**here**](toolkit/archiving-code.md#check-whether-the-repo-contains-code-and-is-public) ****whether this is the case. Generated datasets mentioned in this statement should be included in the ‘Major Datasets - generated’ field below. 

![Dataset referenced in the DAS entered into the datasets generated section](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-10-at-16.16.44.png)

All datasets provided need to be publicly available at the point of publication. The author must provide a direct URL to the dataset, not the URL for the entire database. Follow this link and check that you are able to access the dataset. If you need to create a free account in order to view the data then that is okay as it is still technically publicly available. 

### Impact Statement 

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-08.41.37.png)

### Author keywords 

### Research Organism

### Editors and reviewers 

* The senior and reviewing editors need to have their full name, institution and country listed.
* Reviewers require a full name, but institution and country are optional. If a country is listed without an institution, remove the country.
* For both sets of names, the same rules as for authors apply - names split properly, no full-stops after initials etc.



![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-08.42.18.png)

### Related articles 

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-09.17.11.png)

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-09.17.20.png)

### Queries 

This is where your queries to the author from the content processors and queries to the typesetter from Production will appear. You should check the 'open queries' section and take any steps required **\(expand\)**. You should also check the 'resolved queries' section to ensure that all of the necessary action has been taken to address these. 

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-09.17.41.png)

### Changes 

Now navigate to the ‘Changes’ tab. Recorded here is every edit made by the author, Exeter and Crossref. These changes will be automatically approved unless you reject them. When reviewing the changes, you can toggle between viewing the main article text with and without tracked  changes by clicking on the eye symbol at the top of the window.

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-09.20.08.png)

* Use the drop down menu to select the role that you would like to filter for. 
* You will need to filter for those made by the content processors, to ensure that no errors have been introduced. 
* Pay attention to cases where the author has reverted or change substantial sections of the copy-editor’s changes to make sure the text still makes sense and so that we are aware of anything that needs feeding back. 
* Author changes need to be checked one at a time and any mistakes they may have introduced \(stray letters, missing or extra spaces etc\) should be corrected. 
* At this stage, the author should NOT be rewriting large sections of their text. If they have done so, raise the changes with Editorial to check whether the editors need to approve them. Rewording a sentence is OK as long as the content is largely the same. Rewriting the entire discussion is not!
* If the author has made edits in the Decision letter or Author response sections, you may want to consult with the Production team as to whether these should be accepted. Read about which changes are generally acceptable here. You can also check to see if an explanation for the edits has been provided by email or in the notes/response to queries. 

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-09.20.15.png)

### Figures, Tables and Additional Files tabs

Open each of these tabs and scroll through each item. 

* Check that each item is labelled with the correct category, either as a ‘Figure’, ‘Video’, ‘Table’, ‘Equation’ or ‘Figure Supplement’. 
* Check that each item has a label and title \(legend optional\) and check that the numbering on the items is correct. 
* Watch a few seconds of each video to make sure that they are functioning correctly. 
* Once you have made these checks, navigate to the ‘Supplementary files’ tab and ensure that each item downloads correctly.

### References 

Check that all the journal references have DOIs. If a reference does not have a DOI, it will be highlighted with a red line. You can check the details against the Crossref DOI checker \(registered email: production@elifesciences.org\) which should identify the corresponding DOI if one exists.

### XML

We then validate the XML using our [**XML Validator**](https://basex-validator.elifesciences.org/)**.** Download the XML file from the top tab and then drag it onto the 'Upload XML' box on the validator webpage. Then click the 'Final' button. This will highlight any errors or style issues that might need fixing in the article. Items highlighted as warnings should be checked and then either addressed or ignored. Errors will need to be fixed. Clicking on the hyperlinked warning/error message will take you to its relevant entry on the Production GitBook which should help you rectify the issue if action is required. 

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-10.28.02.png)

You also need to click 'Validate Pub Date'. This will prompt a pop up which will notify you if any of these values are unexpected and need looking into. 

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-12.28.02.png)

### Download PDFs

Scroll down the PDFs, paying particular attention to the figures and tables, ensuring that there are no rendering issues.

### Signing off 

To do this, click on the 'Approve' tab at the top of the page. This will prompt the pop up below, where you should select the appropriate option depending on the state of readiness of the article. 

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-08-at-12.21.34.png)

### Updating the actions sheet 

It is important that all articles in Continuum are recorded on the Production actions document. Open the document, and navigate to the section headed with today’s date. Underneath your section, add your article in the following format:

* \[Article number\] Loading...
* Once your article has loaded onto Continuum \(this can take some time\), you can change this to: \[Article number\] Ready to check 

If the article is scheduled for press, this should be captured in the following way:

* \[Article number\] PRESS \[press date, time\] Scheduled 

![Press article marked as scheduled on the actions sheet](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-10-at-11.50.13.png)

## Publisher Check 

This is the stage prior to content being sent to authors. The majority of research content will skip this stage, that is unless they require a higher copyediting level. Feature content, however, will always come into this stage. You can find out how to carry out pre-author checks for feature content ****[**here**](article-details/content/feature-content.md#pre-author-checks)**.**
