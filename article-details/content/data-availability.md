## What is the data availability section?

The data availability section provides information on how to access the data used in or generated by the work being reported in an article. eLife strongly encourages authors to deposit any data they generate in a dedicated open repository so that it is available for further study and to allow the replication of their results, and to acknowledge any previously published datasets that they have used.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-11.15.49.png)

This section consists of three parts - the data availability statement, generated datasets and previously published datasets.

* **Data availability statement**: a short paragraph describing the data that has been generated and where it has been deposited. If all the data is contained in the article and supporting files, or no data was generated at all, this will be stated instead.
* **Generated datasets**: reference details for all generated datasets. These are entered as data references but are listed here rather than in the main reference list. Full bibliographic details are required for each entry (author list, year, title, database, a direct link and an identifier).
* **Previously published datasets**: reference details for all previous datasets that were used. Same as the above, only for data that was used in the work, rather than generated by it.

In research content (excepting Scientific Correspondence) and Feature Template 5 articles, the data availability statement is mandatory. The other two parts are optional, depending on whether any major datasets were generated or used. If only a small amount of data was generated, the authors may chose to include it as source data files for their article rather than submitting it to a repository, meaning no datasets need to be listed in this section. Relatedly, if previously published data was taken wholly from a journal article rather than from a repository, citing that article in the main text is sufficient and no entry in the data availability section is required. Finally, in the case where no data was generated at all, the data availability statement should reflect this.

Scientific Correspondence articles and Feature Templates 1, 2, 3 and 4 do not require a data availability section.

## What needs to be checked?

### Data availability statement

The data availability statement should be a single paragraph consisting of complete sentences, ending in a full stop. Spelling and grammar errors should be corrected in the same manner as the main text.

The contents of the statement should be reflected in the rest of the dataset section. If specific generated or previously published datasets are mentioned in the statement, they should be [entered](data-availability.md#adding-datasets) under the appropriate headings below. If the authors mention using an [entire database](data-availability.md#whole-databases-entered-as-datasets), however, it will not be appropriate to add a citation entry.

Any statement that indicates data is [available on request](data-availability.md#approved-on-request-data) from the authors will need to be approved by Editorial prior to publication. Cases where this is acceptable include exceptionally large datasets that cannot be supported by existing repositories and patient data that cannot be anonymised.

Data availability statements may also mention code that has been made publicly available by the authors. Instructions on how to deal with this can be found [**here**](../../toolkit/archiving-code.md).

### Generated datasets

Each entry under the generated datasets heading should be a complete data citation in eLife style. Individual authors should be listed in 'surname initials' style (e.g. Smith JS), and a year, title, database and identifier should all be present. A direct URL should also be present for each dataset. Links that just go to a database homepage will need to be replaced. See below for examples of how to do this.

In this section only, references that would result in identical citation details (e.g. two or more datasets that would be Smith et al., 2020) do not need to be distinguished with a, b, c etc after the year.

Each dataset listed must be publicly available at the point of publication. This can be checked by accessing the provided URL. See [below](data-availability.md#data-that-is-not-yet-public) for actions in cases where data is not yet available.

Under no circumstances should journal articles be listed as datasets - these should be given in the main reference list only.

### Previously published datasets

The same rules apply as for generated datasets, though it is far less likely that the data will not be publicly available.

## Examples

### Adding datasets

Datasets will usually be entered by the authors on the submission system when they are uploading their article. The details will then be included in the export XML for content processing. At any point during proofing, datasets may be added or removed. Clicking the 'add dataset' control will bring up this editor:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-12.53.23.png)

Each of these fields will need to be completed for the dataset to pass schematron validation.

* **Authors**: Enter each author name as a surname followed by initials. A comma separated list (Smith J, Bloggs T, Muggins I, . . . ) may be pasted into this field and will process into separate names when the return key is pressed.
* **Year**: This should be the year that the dataset was made publicly available. For generated datasets, be aware that this might not be the same as the year of publication for the current article.
* **Dataset title**: The title for the dataset. This is often descriptive of the contents, but may also reflect the article to which the data is related (e.g. 'Data from: Computational 3D histological phenotyping of whole zebrafish by X-ray histotomography' for a Dryad dataset).
* **Dataset URL**: A direct link to the dataset. This should not be a link to a database home page (e.g. https://www.rcsb.org/) but should instead take the reader straight to the data.&#x20;
* **Database**: The name of the repository in which the data has been deposited.
* **Identifier**: A unique string that can be used to identify the dataset. This may be a DOI, an accession number or simply an ID unique to the database in which the data has been stored.
* **pub-id-type**: The type of identifier present. Chose from: accession, doi. This cannot be left as 'other'. Guidance on which databases take which value for this field can be found [here](data-availability.md#database-examples).

Once all the fields are completed, the dataset can be saved and it will appear in the relevant section. The form is the same for generated and previously published datasets.

### Incomplete datasets

Sometimes, the authors will not have provided the complete dataset information when they submit the article. This can be because they did not have the finalised details, or simply because they did not want to fill out all the fields at the time. The full details must be added prior to publication.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-04-28-at-14.31.55.png)

For example if the authors have simply added 'Smith et al.' or similar in the submission system, the full author list will need to be located and entered. For some datasets, this can be as simple as following the URL, since the page will often show the required details. See [https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4lk1](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4lk1):

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-14.32.57.png)

The same method can be used to identify missing titles, publication dates and so on.

However, some databases do not display the required information in an easily accessible manner. The NCBI BioProject, for example, will usually only show the institution or group from which the data was deposited, rather than the individual researchers responsible.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-14.37.01.png)

In cases where the dataset information cannot be found from the link, or the authors have not provided a proper URL in the first place, the following query should be used to ask the author to provide the missing details.

* Please provide the full author list, year, title, direct URL, database name and accession number/DOI (where not already provided) for this dataset .

In cases where the authors have not provided a URL, or where they have provided a link to the database homepage rather than a specific dataset, it may be possible to derive the specific URL. For example, if the dataset is in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), and the authors provide an accession number, GSE143881, then the direct URL will be [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143881](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143881). Further examples of URLs can be found [below](data-availability.md#database-examples). It will usually be possible to replace the identifier within the example link with the one the authors have provided to get the final URL. Please note, however, that this link may not be active yet (this might be why the authors did not provide it), so action will need to be [taken accordingly](data-availability.md#data-that-is-not-yet-public).

If it is not possible to derive the URL from the information provided (e.g. the authors did not provide an identifier, or the database has highly complex URLs), please use the following author query:

* Please enter a direct URL for this dataset, not just the homepage for the database as a whole.

### Data available 'on request'

Many journals allow authors to make their data available only 'on request', meaning that a reader must contact the corresponding author to receive the data underlying an article. To ensure openness, eLife instead asks authors to deposit all their data in a dedicated subject-specific repository or a more general archive such as Dryad or figshare, where it will be available to anyone who wants it.

If an article is submitted with a data availability statement saying that generated data is available on request, the Editorial team will ask the authors to upload it to an appropriate repository. Usually there will be no problem with this and the data statement will be updated with the details of where the data was submitted. On occasion, however, the authors may push back. This can be because of unfamiliarity with the available options and in these cases, the Editorial team will continue to work with the authors to find an appropriate solution. However, it can also be because the dataset is simply too large (in the range of terabytes of data) for any repository to accept, necessitating a custom solution such as a dedicated institutional server.

> The raw data that support the findings of this study are several TBs in size and are therefore available on request. A source data file for the main figures has been provided.

Another reason for not making the data publicly available is when it contains identifying information about patients or participants in human trials, or when permission to share medical information contained in the dataset was not granted.

> As participants did not give consent for their functional MRI data to be released publicly within the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 of the EU, these data can be made available on request to the corresponding author.

In both these cases, 'on request' data is permitted with the approval of the editors.

The status of the editors' approval of a data availability statement that says data is available 'on request' should be indicated using a red sticky note in the submission system, which will be exported as a production comment.&#x20;

#### Approved 'on request' data

![Note in submission system](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-05-13-at-12.51.32.png)

![Note in proofing system](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-05-13-at-12.52.37.png)

If the editors gave their approval before the article was exported from the submission system, this will be indicated in the Production Comments. If such a note is present, no further action needs to be taken and any warnings about 'on request' in the data availability statement can be ignored.

#### Pending 'on request' data

If the editors have yet to approve the data availability statement, or the Editorial team are still corresponding with the authors about submitting their data, this will also be indicated in the notes.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-05-13-at-13.13.32.png)

An article cannot be published until any outstanding issues with the data availability have been resolved, but proofing may proceed in the meantime.

If the Editorial team resolve this issue, they will inform the Production team how the data section needs to be updated via email or slack message. If the article is still at pre-editing at this point, the Production team should add a note to the proofing system dashboard stating what needs to be updated. The pre-editor should check these notes for instructions and act accordingly.

If there is mention of 'on request' data and the production comments state that data issues are pending, but there are no notes on the dashboard, the following author query should be added to the data availability statement:

* eLife requires all datasets associated with an article to be made freely and widely available (unless there are strong reasons to restrict access, for example in the case of human subjects data), in the most useful formats, and according to the relevant reporting standards. Please confirm that the data currently available upon request are being deposited to a subject repository or a general repository, and update the data statement accordingly. If you are already corresponding with the editorial team about this issue, please let us know.

#### 'On request' data with no note

If approval or ongoing action for 'on request' data has not been indicated with production comments, the following author query should be added:

* eLife requires all datasets associated with an article to be made freely and widely available (unless there are strong reasons to restrict access, for example in the case of human subjects data), in the most useful formats, and according to the relevant reporting standards. Please confirm that the data currently available upon request are being deposited to a subject repository or a general repository, and update the data statement accordingly. If you are already corresponding with the editorial team about this issue, please let us know.

This issue must be resolved before publication, so further action will need to be taken by the Production team at the post-author stage. If the authors have indicated that they have submitted the data to a repository, the data section should be updated with the details. If they have given a reason for the data not to be made publicly available, this should be communicated to the Editorial team who may need to OK it with the editors. If the authors have requested further advice or help with submitting their data to Dryad, the Editorial team should be asked to provide this.

### Data available 'on acceptance'

Related to the above, sometimes when authors are submitting their article, they will hold back data in order to keep it confidential until the article has passed peer review.

> All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files. Source data files will be made available upon acceptance

They may also state that the data will only be made publicl on publication of the article.

> Sequencing data have been deposited in GEO, accession codes will be made public upon publication.

In these cases, the article should be updated with the full dataset information and/or additional source data files. Ideally this will happen before export from the submission system (e.g. when the revised submission is uploaded). However, sometimes there will be a delay and an article will be exported before the data has been finalised.

If the Editorial team are working on this issue, they may contact the Production team following article export to provide the final data information. In this case, the Production team should add a note to the proofing system dashboard stating what needs to be updated. The pre-editor should check these notes for instructions and act accordingly.

If a data statement still indicates that data will be 'available upon acceptance' or similar, the following queries should be used depending on whether the statement refers to datasets or files:

* Please provide the full details for the mentioned dataset(s) (authors, year, title, database, identifier, direct URL) and ensure that the data is publicly available.
* Please provide the source data files mentioned here along with descriptive titles. Please indicate where they should be cited in the main text if appropriate.

At the post-author stage, once the author has provided these details, the data availability section will most likely need to be updated with the final details for the datasets and/or source data files. In some cases, however, the data will have been incorporated into the main article and the mention of 'on acceptance' data can be deleted.

### Data mentioned in the statement but not listed as a citation

Authors will sometimes mention data in their data availability statement without entering the corresponding dataset details.

> Data and codes have been archived at the Open Science Framework ([https://osf.io/cvrb2/](https://osf.io/cvrb2/)).

If they have provided the database name and identifier or a URL, as in the above example, it should be possible to add a generated dataset entry for this dataset. For the Open Science Framework, the details can be taken from the landing page:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-15.51.17.png)

If it is not possible to add the dataset(s) based on the information provided, either because it is incomplete, the data is not yet public or the dataset landing page does not provide all the required details, please query the author:

* Please provide the full details for the mentioned dataset(s) (authors, year, title, database, identifier, direct URL) and ensure that the data is publicly available.

A variation on this issue occurs when the authors do not have the final details for their dataset when they are submitting their article:

> All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files. Source files have been provided for Figure 9. We are working with www.webKnossos.org to provide a direct link to our electron micrograph dataset.

In these cases, the same author query is appropriate and the data availability statement will need to be updated once the authors have provided the full information.

### GitHub repositories entered as datasets

Sometimes, authors may enter the details for GitHub repositories as generated datasets. This will only be appropriate if there is data on those repositories instead of, or in addition to, code.

In the following example, there is no way to tell whether this is the case from the provided details:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-09-08-at-12.01.57.png)

However, by accessing the repository page, the presence of data can be discerned from the description and from the folder names:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-09-08-at-11.58.06.png)

If it is clear from the entered details or the repository page that data is present, it is acceptable to retain the dataset entry. In cases where it is unclear whether the repository contains data, the author should be queried to clarify the issue:

* Does this repository contain source data as well as or instead of source code for your article? If no data is present, this dataset entry will need to be removed.

In cases where the GitHub repository only contains code, the dataset entry should be removed. Mentions of the repository in the data availability statement should be retained, however, and in all other respects, the normal procedure regarding [**code archiving**](../../toolkit/archiving-code.md) should be followed.

In the rare case that a repository contains only data, the dataset entry should be retained but there is no requirement to archive the corresponding repo.

### Journal articles entered as datasets

Some authors misunderstand the instructions around datasets and include citations of journal articles in the data availability section, thinking that they need to include mentions of previously published articles from which they have taken data:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-04-28-at-14.47.58.png)

These can usually be because the URL provided will be a journal link, journal DOI or a PubMed or PMC link (e.g. https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19057, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature19057, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16237209).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-05-12-at-13.58.34.png)

If following this link leads to a journal website or a PubMed/PMC page, it is not appropraite for this entry to be left in the datasets section.

Provided the article is also mentioned in the main reference list and cited in the text, the data entry should be removed. If the reference is not in the main reference list, the author should be asked to move it there with the following query:

* This section is for individual datasets deposited to dedicated repositories only. Citations of previous journal publications should be placed in the main reference list. Please indicate where in the article text this reference should be cited.

### Whole databases entered as datasets

Some authors will enter citations of entire databases or data browsers. Since this section is only intended to cover individual datasets, this is inappropriate. Usually, it is possible to spot these by the lack of identifier in the information provided (either on its own or in the URL). For example, the following is a citation of Ensembl ([https://www.ensembl.org/index.html](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html)), a genome browser.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-04-28-at-10.57.58.png)

Searching the text for 'Ensembl' shows that the authors downloaded multiple genomes from this site as part of their work and that they cited the appropriate publication in accordance with Ensembl's citation guidelines ([https://www.ensembl.org/info/about/publications.html](https://www.ensembl.org/info/about/publications.html)).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-04-28-at-11.01.38.png)

The citation of the database could therefore be removed completely from the previously published datasets section.

If the authors do not mention the database within their text, they will need to be queried to clarify whether they used the whole database or if specific datasets can be listed instead.

* This section is for individual datasets only. Whole databases should be cited in the main text rather than listed here. Please provide the details for any specific datasets used, or indicate where in the text this database should be mentioned.

Once the authors have responded, the entry for the whole database can be replaced with one or more specific datasets, or removed entirely in favour of a URL link in the main text.

### Data that is not yet public

All datasets listed under generated or previously published should be publicly available at the point of publication. This can be checked by going to the URL provided. If this resolves to a 'dataset still private' screen or returns a 'page not found' message, the dataset has not been released.

For generated datasets, the author will need to be asked to arrange the release of the data. Please note that Dryad datasets in particular will only be released when the article is published online and the Dryad site has detected that publication. This is outside the authors control, so they do not need to be queried about releasing Dryad data.

In all other cases, please add the following query:

* Please make all datasets listed here publicly available as soon as possible.

In some cases, the author may provide a review link for the data rather than the final link. This is to allow the reviewers to access the data before final public release. Such links can be identified by 'review' or 'reviewer' in the URL. For example, [https://dataview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/object/PRJNA475219?reviewer=f1ccdfce21ljl8v6q2v8mctid7](https://dataview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/object/PRJNA475219?reviewer=f1ccdfce21ljl8v6q2v8mctid7) is the review link for the dataset [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA475219](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA475219). Any link like this will need to be replaced with the final dataset URL before publication. If it is not possible to identify the final link based on the reviewer link or the given identifier, the author should be queried:

* Please provide the final URL for this dataset and arrange for it to be released.

Note that reviewer links often work only for a limited period, so you may encounter messages such as the following. Helpfully, these will sometimes provide the final URL.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-16.54.09.png)

Previously published datasets will usually be outside the authors' control. If the link provided returns a 'page not found' message, please add the following author query instead:

* Please confirm the URL or DOI for this dataset as the one provided does not work.

### References to files within the article

If the authors mention specific files or figures within their article, please make sure that they have referenced them correctly in eLife style and are using the final names for these assets. For example, this data statement refers to figures and supplementary files using their originally submitted titles rather than those they would be given in the final article:

> All data analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript. We also provided source data files for: Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5; for supplemental figure S2 and for supplemental tables S1, S2. S3, S4, S5, S6, S7 and S8.

This therefore need to be updated to:

> All data analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript. We also provided source data files for: Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5; for Figure 4—figure supplement 1; and for Supplementary files 1–8.

If it is not clear how to update citations of figures and files to use their final names, please query the authors:

* Please update your data availability statement to use the final labels for all figure supplements and supplementary files mentioned.

### Database examples

The following is a list of commonly encountered databases and the values for pub-id-type and assigning-authority that should be entered for their datasets. Datasets from databases not on this list should use 'other' as the assigning-authority and take whichever pub-id-type is appropriate to the identifier included ('doi' for a database with a URL starting 'https://doi.org', 'accession' otherwise).

URL and DOI link examples are included for illustration purposes. In many cases, these can be modified using a different identifier to produce missing links. If a URL is provided for a database where the pub-id-type should be 'doi', it should be corrected to the equivalent DOI link. This can usually be found on the dataset landing page e.g.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-05-01-at-15.13.39.png)

Please note that there are a couple of databases for which both DOIs and URLs are equally acceptable. This is indicated with / in the pub-id-type column.

| Database                                    | Synonyms                                                                                                                         | pub-id-type   | assigning-authority     | URL and DOI examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Schematron checks

### Content checks

These checks relate to the content of the data availability section. X or XXXXXX refers to quoted text which will change depending on the article.

#### das-sentence-conformity

**Error**: _The Data Availability Statement must end with a full stop._

**Action**: Add a full stop to the end of the data availability statement.

#### pre-das-dryad-conformity

**Warning**: _Data Availability Statement contains the word Dryad, but there is no data citation in the dataset section with a dryad doi and/or database name containing 'Dryad'. If there is a dryad dataset present, ensure that it is captured correctly, otherwise please query the authors for the reference details._

**Action**: This warning indicates at the pre-author stage that Dryad is mentioned in the data availability statement but no dataset entries with the a database name containing 'Dryad' or a Dryad DOI are present. If an entry for a Dryad dataset _is_ present, make sure that the details are corrected. If no Dryad dataset is present but the data availability statement mentions a Dryad DOI, the corresponding dataset should be added under the appropriate heading (generated for data described as coming from the current work, previously published for data described as being used by the current work). The details for the dataset will either be available by following DOI or, in the case of an unreleased generated dataset, will be the same author list as the current article, the current year and the article title preceded by 'Data from: ".

If the data availability statement does not contain the DOI, please add the following author query:

* Please provide the full details for the mentioned dataset(s) (authors, year, title, database, identifier, direct URL) and ensure that the data is publicly available.

#### final-das-dryad-conformity

**Error**: _Data Availability Statement contains the word Dryad, but there is no data citation in the dataset section with a dryad doi and/or database name containing 'Dryad'.._

**Action**: This error indicates at the post-author stage that Dryad is mentioned in the data availability statement but no dataset entries with the a database name containing 'Dryad' or a Dryad DOI are present. If an entry for a Dryad dataset _is_ present, make sure that the details are corrected. If no Dryad dataset is present but the data availability statement mentions a Dryad DOI, the corresponding dataset should be added under the appropriate heading (generated for data described as coming from the current work, previously published for data described as being used by the current work). The details for the dataset will either be available by following DOI or, in the case of an unreleased generated dataset, will be the same author list as the current article, the current year and the article title preceded by 'Data from: ".

If the data availability statement does not contain the DOI, the author will need to be asked to provide the missing details.

#### das-supplemental-conformity

**Warning**: _Data Availability Statement contains the phrase 'supplemental figure'. This will almost certainly need updating to account for eLife's figure labelling._

**Action**: Any mentions of 'supplemental figures' will need to be [updated to use the final labels](data-availability.md#references-to-files-within-the-article) e.g. Figure 1—figure supplement 1. If it is not clear how to do this, add the following author query:

* Please update your data availability statement to use the final labels for all figure supplements and supplementary files mentioned.

#### das-request-conformity-1

**Warning**: _Data Availability Statement contains the phrase 'request'. Does it state data is available upon request, and if so, has this been approved by editorial?_

**Action**: This warning indicates that a data availability statement contains the word 'request', which likely occurs in the context of 'data available on request'. This may be acceptable if it has been approved by the editors. Alternatively, further action may need to be taken. See [above](data-availability.md#data-available-on-request) for further guidance.

Please note that if 'request' is used in a context other than data, it is likely OK. For example,  'materials available on request' is fine and this warning could be ignored.

#### das-doi-conformity-1

**Error**: _Data Availability Statement contains a doi, but it does not contain 'https://doi.org/'. All dois should be updated to include a full 'https://doi.org/...' type link._

**Action**: If a DOI is given in the data availability statement, it should be prefixed with https://doi.org/ so that it will be rendered as a hyperlink in the final publication. For example, '10.5061/dryad.8153g' should be changed to 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8153g'

#### ext-link-child-test-5

**Warning**: _ext-link looks like it points to a review dryad dataset - XXXXXX. Should it be updated?_

**Action**: This warning indicates that the URL for a dataset is a Dryad reviewer link rather than the final DOI. The URL will need to be replaced with the DOI URL (e.g. https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4nb12g2). The DOI string may have been given in the identifier field or in the data availability statement. If not and this warning occurs at the pre-author stage, the following query may be used:

* Please provide the DOI for this dataset.

#### sec-test-3

**Warning**: _Section has a title 'XXXXXX'. Is it a duplicate of the data availability section (and therefore should be removed)?_

**Action**: This warning indicates that there is a section within the main body of an article that has the title 'Data availability' or a common variation of this (e.g. 'Data statement', 'Data and code availability', 'Data accessibility' etc). This can mean that the authors have included a copy of the statement they entered on the submission system.

If the main-text data statement is identical to the one entered in the Data availability section and does not contain any reference citations, it should be deleted entirely. If it is identical and any references cited are also cited elsewhere in the main text, it should also be deleted.

If the statement in the main text contains reference citations that are not cited elsewhere, it must be retained to preserve these citations (live citations cannot currently be included in the data availability statement).

In cases where the main-text data statement and the data availability statement do not match, there are several possible options. If the data availability statement contains information about datasets while the main-text statement says something like "data will be submitted on acceptance", the main-text statement can be deleted.

However, if the main-text statement contains additional information not captured in the data availability statement, it will be necessary for the Production team to contact the Editorial team (who may already be working on this issue) or query the authors in order to clarify what the final data availability statement should read.

For example, in the following case, the data availability statement read:

> Data have been deposited on GEO under the accession number GSE140919. A source data file has been provided.

But an in-text statement mentioned additional data submitted to dbGAP:

> The data for this study have been deposited in the database dbGAP. The sequencing data can be found as GenBank GSE140919. Data can also be found in the included source file.

Since the authors did not provide details for their dbGAP dataset, the authors were asked to provide the missing information but they responded that they had not, in fact, deposited data to dbGAP. The in-text statement was then deleted and the data availability statement was retained as originally provided.

In another instance, the data availability statement was

> All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files

while the in-text equivalent read

> Representative segmented neurons for all presented neuron types will be available at Virtual Fly Brain ([https://www.virtualflybrain.org](https://www.virtualflybrain.org)).

The following query was used to ask the authors for the finalised details:

* Please provide the full details for the mentioned dataset(s) (authors, year, title, database, identifier, direct URL) and ensure that the data is publicly available.

Once these were provided, the dataset was added to the data availability section,  the main-text statement was removed and the text was combined with the data availability statement:

> All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files. Representative segmented neurons for all presented neuron types are available at Virtual Fly Brain ([http://virtualflybrain.org/data/Lee\_Lineage2020](http://virtualflybrain.org/data/Lee\_Lineage2020)).

#### pre-das-elem-person-group-1

**Warning**: _The reference in position XX of the data availability section does not have any authors (no person-group\[@person-group-type='author']). Please ensure to add them in or query the authors asking for the author list._

**Action**: At the pre-author stage, this warning indicates a dataset without any authors. The author most be asked to provide the missing details if they cannot be found using the other dataset information. This warning fires if the `<person-group>` element is missing.

* Please provide the full author list for this dataset.

#### final-das-elem-person-group-1

**Error**: _The reference in position XX of the data availability section does not have any authors (no person-group\[@person-group-type='author']). Please ensure to add them._

#### pre-das-elem-pub-id-1

**Warning**: _The reference in position XX of the data availability section does not have an identifier (no pub-id). Please ensure to add it in or query the authors asking for it._

**Action**: At the pre-author stage, this warning indicates a dataset without an identifier. The author most be asked to provide the missing details if they cannot be found using the other dataset information.

* Please provide the identifier (accession number or DOI) for this dataset.

Alternatively, if the URL and title provided for this dataset indicate that the entry is for an [entire database](data-availability.md#whole-databases-entered-as-datasets), the author may need to be asked to clarify what should be cited:

* This section is for individual datasets only. Whole databases should be cited in the main text rather than listed here. Please provide the details for any specific datasets used, or indicate where in the text this database should be mentioned.

&#x20;This warning fires if the `<pub-id>` element is missing.

#### final-das-elem-pub-id-1

**Error**: _The reference in position XX of the data availability section does not have an identifier (no pub-id). Please ensure to add it in._

**Action**: At the post-author stage, this error indicates a dataset without an identifier. The author should be asked by email to provide the missing details if they cannot be found using the other dataset information. This error fires if the `<pub-id>` element is missing.

#### pre-das-elem-pub-id-2

**Warning**: _The reference in position XX of the data availability section does not have an id (pub-id is empty). Please ensure to add it in or query the authors asking for it._

**Action**: At the pre-author stage, this warning indicates a dataset without an identifier. The author most be asked to provide the missing details if they cannot be found using the other dataset information. This warning fires if the `<pub-id>` element is empty.

* Please provide the identifier (accession number or DOI) for this dataset.

#### final-das-elem-pub-id-2

**Error**: _The reference in position XX of the data availability section does not have an id (pub-id is empty). Please ensure to add it in._

**Action**: At the post-author stage, this error indicates a dataset without an identifier. The author should be asked by email to provide the missing details if they cannot be found using the other dataset information. This error fires if the `<pub-id>` element is empty.

#### pre-das-elem-year-1

**Warning**: _The reference in position XX of the data availability section does not have a year. Please ensure to add it in or query the authors asking for it._

**Action**: At the pre-author stage, this warning indicates a dataset without a year. The author most be asked to provide the missing details if they cannot be found using the other dataset information. This warning fires if the `<year>` element is missing.

* Please provide the year for this dataset.

#### final-das-elem-year-1

**Error**: _The reference in position XX of the data availability section does not have a year. Please ensure to add it in._

**Action**: At the post-author stage, this error indicates a dataset without a year. The author should be asked by email to provide the missing details if they cannot be found using the other dataset information. This error fires if the `<year>` element is missing.

#### pre-das-elem-citation-year-2

**Action**: At the post-author stage, this error indicates a dataset without a year. The author should be asked by email to provide the missing details if they cannot be found using the other dataset information. This error fires if the `<year>` element is empty.

#### pre-das-elem-cit-3

**Warning**: _The reference in position XX of the data availability section has a link (XXXXXX) which is the same as another dataset reference in that section. Dataset reference links should be distinct._

**Action**: This error indicates that a dataset's URL matches that of another dataset in this section. Check to find out which datasets are duplicates and see if the rest of the details match as well. If they do, all but one of the identical datasets should be deleted. If the title or identifier do not match when the URLs do, check to see if the URL should be updated to match the identifier.

For example, if the URLs for two datasets are both [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135351](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135351), but the identifiers are GSE135351 and GSE143881, the dataset for the second identifier should have the URL [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143881](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143881).

If you are unable to do the above, or it is unclear what the URLs should be, then please add the following author query:

* Please enter a direct URL for this dataset, not just the homepage for the database as a whole.

#### final-das-elem-cit-3

**Error**: _The reference in position XX of the data availability section has a link (XXXXXX) which is the same as another dataset reference in that section. Dataset reference links should be distinct._

**Action**: This error indicates that a dataset's URL matches that of another dataset in this section. Check to find out which datasets are duplicates and see if the rest of the details match as well. If they do, all but one of the identical datasets should be deleted. If the title or identifier do not match when the URLs do, check to see if the URL should be updated to match the identifier.

For example, if the URLs for two datasets are both [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135351](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135351), but the identifiers are GSE135351 and GSE143881, the dataset for the second identifier should have the URL [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143881](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143881).

#### das-elem-cit-4

**Warning**: _The reference in position XX of the data availability section has a pub-id (XXXXXX) which is the same as another dataset reference in that section. This is very likely incorrect. Dataset reference pub-id should be distinct._

**Action**: This warning indicates that a dataset's identifier matches that of another dataset in this section. Check to find out which datasets are duplicates and see if the rest of the details match as well. If they do, all but one of the identical datasets should be deleted. If the title or URL do not match when the identifiers do, check to see if the identifier should be updated to match the URL.

For example, if the identifiers for two datasets are both GSE135351, but the URLs are [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135351](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135351) and [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143881](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143881), the dataset for the second URL should have the identifier GSE143881.

#### das-elem-cit-5

**Warning**: _The reference in position XX of the data availability section has a pub-id (XXXXXX) which is the same as in another reference in the reference list. Is the same reference in both the reference list and data availability section?_

**Action**: This warning indicates that a dataset's identifier matches that of an identifier in a reference in the reference list. If it's the case that the same reference is included in both places, then check the amount of times that the reference in the reference list has been cited. If it hasn't been cited or if it has only been cited in a duplicate data availability section, then the reference in the reference list can be deleted. If they aren't duplicate references but have the same identifiers, then it's likely that one of them is wrong. If you cannot determine which is incorrect, then at pre-authors stages an author query should be added on the identifier in the reference list:

* Please confirm that the details for this reference are correct. The identifier is currently the same as an identifier for one of the dataset references in the Data availability section.

However, please note that if the dataset entry points to a journal article, it will likely need to be removed from the data availability section anyway - see [**above for details**](data-availability.md#journal-articles-entered-as-datasets).

#### das-pub-id-1

**Error**: _Each pub-id element must have an @pub-id-type which is either accession or doi._

**Action**: This error indicates that a pub-id-type has not been set for a dataset (it has been left as 'other'). Set the pub-id-type to the appropriate value, either accession or doi. The values for this attribute for datasets in commonly encountered databases can be found [above](data-availability.md#database-examples).

#### data-ref-given-names-test-1

**Warning**: _Given names should always be initialised. Ref contains a given names with a string longer than 4 characters - 'XXXXXX' in XXXXXX. Is this a surname captured as given names? Or a fully spelt out given names?_

**Action**: This warning indicates a given name in a `<name>` element within a dataset that consists of more than four characters, likely meaning it is a full name rather than just a set of initials (XXXXXX in this message will be the given name and the full author name, respectively). This might be because the name has been entered in full as 'Smith Jonathan' or because the wrong name format has been used (e.g. 'J Smith' or 'Jonathan Smith'), resulting in the surname being tagged as the given name.

The affected name will need to be corrected to 'Smith J' format.

#### data-geo-test

**Warning**: _Data reference with the title 'XXXXXX' has a 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo' type link, but the database name is not 'NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus' - XXXXXX. Is that correct?_

**Action**: This warning indicates that the database name for a dataset is not the one expected based on the URL provided. This may be due to differing spacing or capitalisation, or the authors may have entered an alternative name for the database. Synonyms for common database names can be found in the list of [database examples](data-availability.md#database-examples). In most cases, the database name should be corrected to the value given in the message. However, please check the database name displayed when following the URL provided and if it does not correspond to the warning message, the Production team will need to investigate further.

XXXXXX will be the dataset title and the current database name in this entry, respectively.

#### data-nucleotide-test

**Warning**: _Data reference with the title 'XXXXXX' has a 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore' type link, but the database name is not 'NCBI Nucleotide' or 'NCBI GenBank' - XXXXXX. Is that correct?_

**Action**: This warning indicates that the database name for a dataset is not the one expected based on the URL provided. This may be due to differing spacing or capitalisation, or the authors may have entered an alternative name for the database. Synonyms for common database names can be found in the list of [database examples](data-availability.md#database-examples). In most cases, the database name should be corrected to the value given in the message. However, please check the database name displayed when following the URL provided and if it does not correspond to the warning message, the Production team will need to investigate further.

XXXXXX will be the dataset title and the current database name in this entry, respectively.

#### data-bioproject-test

**Warning**: _Data reference with the title 'XXXXXX' has a 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject' type link, but the database name is not 'NCBI BioProject' - XXXXXX. Is that correct?_

**Action**: This warning indicates that the database name for a dataset is not the one expected based on the URL provided. This may be due to differing spacing or capitalisation, or the authors may have entered an alternative name for the database. Synonyms for common database names can be found in the list of [database examples](data-availability.md#database-examples). In most cases, the database name should be corrected to the value given in the message. However, please check the database name displayed when following the URL provided and if it does not correspond to the warning message, the Production team will need to investigate further.

XXXXXX will be the dataset title and the current database name in this entry, respectively.

#### data-dbgap-test

**Warning**: _Data reference with the title 'XXXXXX' has a 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap' type link, but the database name is not 'NCBI dbGaP' - XXXXXX. Is that correct?_

**Action**: This warning indicates that the database name for a dataset is not the one expected based on the URL provided. This may be due to differing spacing or capitalisation, or the authors may have entered an alternative name for the database. Synonyms for common database names can be found in the list of [database examples](data-availability.md#database-examples). In most cases, the database name should be corrected to the value given in the message. However, please check the database name displayed when following the URL provided and if it does not correspond to the warning message, the Production team will need to investigate further.

XXXXXX will be the dataset title and the current database name in this entry, respectively.

#### data-popset-test

**Warning**: _Data reference with the title 'XXXXXX' has a 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/popset' type link, but the database name is not 'NCBI PopSet' - XXXXXX. Is that correct?_

**Action**: This warning indicates that the database name for a dataset is not the one expected based on the URL provided. This may be due to differing spacing or capitalisation, or the authors may have entered an alternative name for the database.

However, please check the database name displayed when following the DOI provided and if it does not correspond to the warning message, the Production team will need to investigate further.

XXXXXX will be the dataset title and the current database name in this entry, respectively.

#### data-wwpdb-test-2

**Warning**: _Data reference with the title 'XXXXXX' has the database name XXXXXX, but no doi starting with '10.2210', which is incorrect._

**Action**: This warning fires when the identifier for the indicated dataset is not a DOI starting with the expected string based on the database name. See [above](data-availability.md#database-examples) for examples of DOIs for commonly encountered databases. Ensure that a DOI of the correct type is entered in the identifier field. If this information cannot be located, query the author to provide the missing details:

* Please provide the final DOI for this dataset.

#### data-sbgdb-test-1

**Warning**: _Data reference with the title 'XXXXXX' has a doi starting with '10.15785/SBGRID' but the database name is not 'SBGrid Data Bank' - XXXXXX._

**Action**: This warning indicates that the database name for a dataset is not the one expected based on the DOI provided. This may be due to differing spacing or capitalisation, or the authors may have entered an alternative name for the database. Synonyms for common database names can be found in the list of [database examples](data-availability.md#database-examples). In most cases, the database name should be corrected to the value given in the message. However, please check the database name displayed when following the DOI provided and if it does not correspond to the warning message, the Production team will need to investigate further.

XXXXXX will be the dataset title and the current database name in this entry, respectively.

#### data-sbgdb-test-2

**Warning**: _Data reference with the title 'XXXXXX' has the database name XXXXXX, but no doi starting with '10.15785/SBGRID', which is likely incorrect._

**Action**: This warning fires when the identifier for the indicated dataset is not a DOI starting with the expected string based on the database name. See [above](data-availability.md#database-examples) for examples of DOIs for commonly encountered databases. Ensure that a DOI of the correct type is entered in the identifier field. If this information cannot be located, query the author to provide the missing details:

* Please provide the final DOI for this dataset.

#### data-harvard-dataverse-test-1

**Warning**: _Data reference with the title 'XXXXXX' has a doi starting with '10.7910' but the database name is not 'Harvard Dataverse' - XXXXXX._

**Action**: This warning indicates that the database name for a dataset is not the one expected based on the DOI provided. This may be due to differing spacing or capitalisation, or the authors may have entered an alternative name for the database. Synonyms for common database names can be found in the list of [database examples](data-availability.md#database-examples). In most cases, the database name should be corrected to the value given in the message. However, please check the database name displayed when following the DOI provided and if it does not correspond to the warning message, the Production team will need to investigate further.

XXXXXX will be the dataset title and the current database name in this entry, respectively.

#### data-harvard-dataverse-test-2

**Warning**: _Data reference with the title 'XXXXXX' has the database name XXXXXX, but no doi starting with '10.7910', which is likely incorrect._

**Action**: This warning fires when the identifier for the indicated dataset is not a DOI starting with the expected string based on the database name. See [above](data-availability.md#database-examples) for examples of DOIs for commonly encountered databases. Ensure that a DOI of the correct type is entered in the identifier field. If this information cannot be located, query the author to provide the missing details:

* Please provide the final DOI for this dataset.

#### data-encode-test-1

**Warning**: _Data reference with the title 'XXXXXX' has a 'www.encodeproject.org' type link, but the database name is not 'ENCODE' - XXXXXX. Is that correct?_

**Action**: This warning indicates that the database name for a dataset is not the one expected based on the URL provided. This may be due to differing spacing or capitalisation, or the authors may have entered an alternative name for the database. Synonyms for common database names can be found in the list of [database examples](data-availability.md#database-examples). In most cases, the database name should be corrected to the value given in the message. However, please check the database name displayed when following the URL provided and if it does not correspond to the warning message, the Production team will need to investigate further.

XXXXXX will be the dataset title and the current database name in this entry, respectively.

#### data-encode-test-3

**Warning**: _Data reference with the title 'XXXXXX' has an ENCODE 'www.encodeproject.org' type link, but is not marked as an accession type link._

**Action**: This warning fires when the pub-id-type given for the indicated dataset does not match the expected value based on the URL provided. Pub-id-types for commonly encountered databases can be found [above](data-availability.md#database-examples). Please correct the pub-id-type to the expected value.

#### data-emdr-test-1

**Warning**: _Data reference with the title 'XXXXXX' has a 'www.emdataresource.org' type link, but the database name is not 'EMDataResource' - XXXXXX. Is that correct?_

**Action**: This warning indicates that the database name for a dataset is not the one expected based on the URL provided. This may be due to differing spacing or capitalisation, or the authors may have entered an alternative name for the database. Synonyms for common database names can be found in the list of [database examples](data-availability.md#database-examples). In most cases, the database name should be corrected to the value given in the message. However, please check the database name displayed when following the URL provided and if it does not correspond to the warning message, the Production team will need to investigate further.

XXXXXX will be the dataset title and the current database name in this entry, respectively.

#### data-emdr-test-3

**Warning**: _Data reference with the title 'XXXXXX' has an EMDataResource 'www.emdataresource.org' type link, but is not marked as an accession type link._

**Action**: This warning fires when the pub-id-type given for the indicated dataset does not match the expected value based on the URL provided. Pub-id-types for commonly encountered databases can be found [above](data-availability.md#database-examples). Please correct the pub-id-type to the expected value.

#### das-elem-citation-child-1

**Error**: _Reference in the data availability section has a \<XXX> element in a \<ZZZ> element which is not allowed._

**Action**: \<XXX> will be a disallowed XML element(s) present in \<ZZZ>, which will be either the title (`<data-title>`) or database name (`<source>`). The only XML elements allowed within these fields are \<italic>, \<sup> or \<sub>. To address this warning, remove any formatting that is not italic, superscript or subscript, and remove any hyperlinks. For example, if the warning reads "\<bold> element in a \<source> element", bold formatting is present in the database name and should be removed; similarly, "\<ext-link> element in a \<source> element" indicates a hyperlink that needs to be removed.

#### final-das-p-conformity-1

**Error**: _p element in data availability section contains no content. It must be removed._

**Action**: This error will fire at post-author stages if a \<p> element in the data availability section contains not content. The \<p> element should be removed if it is superfluous, or the authors should be asked for a data availability statement if there isn't one at all (and this should be checked with Editorial when provided).

### XML structure checks

These checks relate to the XML structure of the data availability section. X or XXXXXX refers to quoted text which will change depending on the article. For more information about what the XML should look like, [**see below**](data-availability.md#xml-structure).

#### back-test-3

**Error**: _One and only one Data availability section (sec\[@sec-type="data-availability"]) must be present (as a child of back) for 'XXXXXX'._

**Action**: This error will fire for research content (except 'Scientific Correspondence') with a publication date after 31 May 2018 that have no data availability section`<sec sec-type="data-availability">` present in the `<back>` element for research content, or if there is more than one section of this type present. The section will need to be added in, or the extra sections will need to be removed.

The current data availability tagging was introduced at the beginning of June 2018.

#### back-test-10

**Warning**: _One and only one Data availability section (sec\[@sec-type="data-availability"]) should be present (as a child of back) for 'XXXXXX'. Is this a new version which was published first without one? If not, then it certainly needs adding._

**Action**: This warning will fire for research content (except 'Scientific Correspondence') with a publication date before 1 June 2018 that have no data availability section  `<sec sec-type="data-availability">` present in the `<back>` element for research content, or if there is more than one section of this type present. Extra sections will need to be removed but if this is a new version of a very old article, no data availability section is permitted.

The current data availability tagging was introduced at the beginning of June 2018, so new versions of articles before this date will be tagged differently.

#### data-p-presence

**Error**: _At least one p element must be present in sec\[@sec-type='data=availability']._

**Action**: There must be a paragraph within the Data availability section (for the Data availablity statement). If this is not present, it must be added in. The Production team will need to check the submission system for the missing information if it is not present in the export XML.

#### das-elem-person-group-2

**Error**: _The reference in position XX of the data availability has XX person-group elements, which is incorrect_

**Action**: One and only one `<person-group>` element must be present in each dataset entry. Add an author list if this is missing and remove extra elements of this type if they are present.

#### das-elem-cit-1

**Error**: _Every reference in the data availability section must have an @specific-use. The reference in position XX does not._

**Action**: Each entry for a dataset in this section should be an `<element-citation>` with the `specific-use` attribute (set to either `specific-use="isSupplementedBy"` for generated datasets or `specific-use="references"` for previously published datasets). This warning fires if the `specific-use` attribute is missing, likely due to an XML generation error. This attribute will need to be added in. Technical support will be required to fix this issue.

#### das-elem-cit-2

**Error**: _The reference in position XX of the data availability section has a @specific-use value of XXXXXX, which is not allowed. It must be 'isSupplementedBy' or 'references'._

**Action**: Each entry for a dataset in this section should be an `<element-citation>` with the `specific-use` attribute (set to either `specific-use="isSupplementedBy"` for generated datasets or `specific-use="references"` for previously published datasets). This warning will fire if the `specific-use` attribute has another value. The value of the attribute will need to be corrected to one of the allowed values. Technical support will be required to fix this issue.

#### pre-das-pub-id-2

**Warning**: _Each pub-id element which is not a doi must have an @xlink-href (which is not empty). If the link is not available please query the authors asking for it._

**Action**: This will fire at pre-author stages. If a `<pub-id>` element does not contain a DOI, the dataset URL should appear as an attribute on this element. Check that a URL has been provided and ask the author for it if it is missing:

* Please provide the final URL for this dataset and arrange for it to be released.

#### final-das-pub-id-2

**Error**: _Each pub-id element which is not a doi must have an @xlink-href (which is not empty)._

**Action**: This will fire at post-author stages. If a `<pub-id>` element does not contain a DOI, the dataset URL should appear as an attribute on this element. Check that a URL has been provided and if it hasn't, the eLife production team should ask the author for it.

#### das-elem-citation-year-1

**Error**: _Every year in a reference must have an @iso-8601-date attribute equal to the numbers in the year. Reference with id XX has a year 'XXXX' but an @iso-8601-date 'XXXX'._

**Action**: For each `<year>` element, an attribute `iso-8601-date` must be present with a value equal to the contents of the year, e.g. `<year iso-8601-date="2013">2013</year>`. This error will occur if the value of the element and its attribute do not match. Try re-entering the year and contact technical support if this error persists.
