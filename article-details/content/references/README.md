# References

## What is a reference list?

Most eLife articles will include a reference list \(otherwise known as a bibliography\) that contains details for all the previous work being cited in the text. These will usually consist mostly of journal articles and books but may also cover websites, papers presented at conferences, software, data and other published material. Whenever research is published, it will be supported with a large number of references; we have had articles with upwards of 150 references. Some review articles, which survey the available literature on a subject, may reach as high as 200+ references.

The reference list is included at the end of the article, in the back matter. References are ordered alphabetically by the surname of the first author for each entry, then by year, and then by the surnames of the second, third, fourth etc authors as necessary. Each reference list covers the entire article in which it appears; references in appendices are not treated separately from those in the main text.

The style used for references in articles - that is, the way the details are formatted and ordered - is derived from the APA style but is unique to eLife. Full author lists are presented online, but where there are more than 20 authors listed, 'et al.' will be used to truncate the list in the PDF \(compare Axten et al., 2021 in the two lists shown above\). This is in order to save space; some journal articles have over 100 authors!

eLife permits references to the following items, for which type-specific guidance has been provided on dedicated pages:

* \*\*\*\*[**Books**](book-references.md)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Conference papers**](conference-reference.md)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Data**](data-references.md)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Journal articles**](journal-references.md)\*\*\*\*
* **Patents**
* \*\*\*\*[**Preprints**](preprint-references.md)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Reports**](report-references.md)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Software**](software-references.md)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Theses**](thesis-references.md)\*\*\*\*

## What needs to be checked?

### Reference ordering

References in eLife are ordered by the following criteria:

* Surname of the first author
* then date of publication
* then, if necessary, surname of second, third, etc authors

So, for example, consider the following selection of references:

* Gilson PR, Nebl T, Vukcevic D, Moritz RL, Sargeant T, Speed TP, Schofield L, Crabb BS. 2006
* Gilson PR, Crabb BS. 2009
* Hillringhaus S, Dasanna AK, Gompper G, Fedosov DA. 2019
* Hillringhaus S, Dasanna AK, Gompper G, Fedosov DA. 2020
* Hoogerbrugge PJ, Koelman JMVA. 1992
* Keeley A, Soldati D. 2004
* Keeley A, Soldati D, Smith J, Bloggs M. 2004
* Koch M. 2016

As you can see, the first author provides the main ordering criterion, followed by the publication date in cases where the first surnames for separate references are the same. In cases where the first surname and date are the same, the second and then third author surnames provide the next level of ordering \(here, Keeley and Soldati are followed by Keeleym Soldati and Smith\).

#### References with the same citation

An additional layer of ordering comes from handling references with identical citations. This refers not to to the reference details themselves but the string that is used to cite them. Consider:

* Keeley A, Soldati D. 2004
* Keeley A, Soldati D, Smith J, Bloggs M. 2004

In the text, these will be cited as 'Keeley and Soldati, 2004' and 'Keeley et al., 2004', respectively, and are therefore easily distinguished. However, if both references were

* Keeley A, Soldati D. 2004
* Keeley A, Soldati D. 2004

then they would both be cited as  'Keeley and Soldati, 2004'. Similarly, if two or more references included the same first surname and date, with the same or different author lists, e.g.

* Keeley A, Smith J, Baum J. 2004
* Keeley A, Soldati D, Smith J, Bloggs M. 2004
* Keeley A, Soldati D, Smith J, Bloggs M. 2004

all of them would be cited as 'Keeley et al., 2004'. In order to prevent confusion, references with identical citation strings are distguished by added a letter to the year. This means the first example becomes

* Keeley A, Soldati D. 2004a
* Keeley A, Soldati D. 2004b

and the second

* Keeley A, Smith J, Baum J. 2004a
* Keeley A, Soldati D, Smith J, Bloggs M. 2004b
* Keeley A, Soldati D, Smith J, Bloggs M. 2004c

resulting in citations of 'Keeley and Soldati, 2004a' and 'Keeley and Soldati, 2004b', and 'Keeley et al., 2004a', 'Keeley et al., 2004b' and 'Keeley et al., 2004c'. The dates are then treated in alphabetical sequence, so '2004b' must appear after '2004a'.

### Combining multiple reference lists

In some instances, authors will provide multiple reference lists in their submitted article files. This will usually entail providing the reference list for an appendix separately from the reference list for the main text, perhaps because these are in separate documents. In these cases, all the reference lists should be combined and any duplicate entries removed.

This will be carried out during initial processing of the article files so there usually will not be nothing to check at the subsequent stages. If an appendix is missed or otherwise needs to be added in later, any references included exclusively in that section should be added to the main reference list.

### General reference formatting



## Schematron warnings

### Content warnings

#### ref-list-title-test

**Warning**: _reference list usually has a title that is 'References', but currently it is 'XXXXXX' - is that correct?_

**Action**: This warning indicates that the reference list has a title other than 'References'. This should be corrected to use the standard heading.

#### ref-list-distinct-1

**Error**: _In the reference list, each reference must be unique in its citation style \(combination of authors and year\). If a reference's citation is the same as anothers, a lowercase letter should be suffixed to the year \(e.g. Smith et al., 2020a\). XXXXXX does not meet this requirement._

**Action**: This error indicates that two or more references have the same citation string e.g. Smith et al., 2020 and Smith et al., 2020. The references will need to be updated to distinguish the citations by applying a a letter to the year field. The first reference cited should have the year updated to e.g. 2020a, the second to 2020b and so on. See [**above**](./#references-with-the-same-citation) for more details on this.

#### err-elem-cit-gen-date-1-2

**Warning**: _The numeric value of the first 4 digits of the &lt;year&gt; element must be between 1700 and the current year + 5 years \(inclusive\). Reference 'XXXXXX' does not meet this requirement as it contains the value 'XXXXXX'.â€“_

**Action**: This warning indicates a reference has a date that is outside the range 1700 to five years past the current year. Any reference that has a year pre-1700 or after the current year+5 will be flagged by this test. The reference should be checked to ensure that no error has occured in processing the details provided by the author; for example, has a volume number been accidentally input as the year?

If the year is correct and pre-1700, check to ensure that publication details have been provided \(publisher name must be present for books, journal name must be present for articles etc\). Please note that for books, the reference should be to the specific edition used and this will usually have a modern publication date that should be used.

If the year is more than five years in the future, the authors should be queried to check the reference details:

* Please confirm that this reference is in press as the year provided is more than five years in the future.

#### err-elem-cit-gen-date-1-4

**Warning**: _The numeric value of the first 4 digits of the @iso-8601-date attribute on the &lt;year&gt; element must be between 1700 and the current year + 5 years \(inclusive\). Reference 'XXXXXX' does not meet this requirement as the attribute contains the value 'XXXXXX'._

**Action**: 

#### err-elem-cit-gen-date-1-6

**Error**: _If the &lt;year&gt; element contains the letter 'a' after the digits, there must be another reference with the same first author surname \(or collab\) with a letter "b" after the year. Reference 'XXXXXX' does not fulfill this requirement._

**Action**: This error indicates that a reference has a year value with a letter 'a' at the end but that there is no subsequent reference with 'b' at the end. Letter suffixes to years should only be added if there are multiple references with the same details that need their citations distinguished. Either the letter must be removed from the indicated reference, or a subsequent reference with the same author/year combindation must be updated to add a 'b' suffice to the year.

#### err-elem-cit-gen-date-1-7

**Error**: _If the &lt;year&gt; element contains any letter other than 'a' after the digits, there must be another reference with the same first author surname \(or collab\) with the preceding letter after the year. Reference 'XXXXXX' does not fulfill this requirement._

**Action**: This error indicates that a reference has a year value with a letter 'a' at the end but that there is no subsequent reference with 'b' at the end. Letter suffixes to years should only be added if there are multiple references with the same details that need their citations distinguished. Either the letter must be removed from the indicated reference, or a subsequent reference with the same author/year combindation must be updated to add a 'b' suffix to the year.

#### elem-cit-source

**Error**: _A &lt;source&gt; element within a XXXXXX type &lt;element-citation&gt; must contain at least two characters. - XXXXXX. See Ref 'XXXXXX'._

**Action**: The error indicates a reference's source field \(journal name, book title, database name etc.\) contains zero or one characters only. This will certainly be a mistake as virtually every source for a reference will consist of at least two characters. Check that the details have been captured correctly from the original article file and correct as necessary. If it is unclear what the source for the reference is, please query the author:

* Please provide the source for this reference \(e.g. book, journal, webiste, or database\).

#### ext-link-attribute-content-match

**Error**: &lt;ext-link&gt; must contain content and have an @xlink:href, the value of which must be the same as the content of &lt;ext-link&gt;. The &lt;ext-link&gt; element in Reference 'XXXXXX' has @xlink:href='XXXXXX' and content 'XXXXXX'.

**Action**:

#### link-href-conformance

**Error**: _@xlink:href must start with either "http://", "https://", or "ftp://". The &lt;ext-link&gt; element in Reference 'XXXXXX' is 'XXXXXX', which does not._

**Action:**

#### err-elem-cit-high-2-2

**Error**: _The order of &lt;element-citation&gt;s in the reference list should be name and date, arranged alphabetically by the first authorâ€™s surname, or by the value of the first &lt;collab&gt; element. In the case of two authors, the sequence should be arranged by both authors' surnames, then date. For three or more authors, the sequence should be the first author's surname, then date. Reference 'XXXXXX' appears to be in a different order._

**Action**:

#### err-elem-cit-high-3-3

**Error**: _The sequence of ids in the &lt;ref&gt; elements must increase monotonically \(e.g. 1,2,3,4,5, . . . ,50,51,52,53, . . . etc\). Reference 'XXXXXX' has the value 'XXXXXX', which does not fit this pattern._

**Action**:

#### err-xref-high-2-1

**Error**: _Citations in the text to references with the same author\(s\) in the same year must be arranged in the same order as the reference list. The xref with the value 'XXXXXX' is in the wrong order in the text. Check all the references to citations for the same authors to determine which need to be changed._

**Action**:

#### err-elem-cit-high-6-2

**Error**: _element-citation must have a publication-type attribute with one of these values: 'journal', 'book', 'data', 'patent', 'software', 'preprint', 'web', 'periodical', 'report', 'confproc', or 'thesis'. Reference 'XXXXXX' has 'XXXXXX'._

**Action**:

#### pre-element-cite-year

**Warning**: _'XXXXXX' type references must have a year. Reference 'XXXXXX' does not. If you are unable to determine this, please ensure to add an author query asking for the year of publication._

**Action**:

#### final-element-cite-year

**Error**: _'XXXXXX' type references must have a year. Reference 'XXXXXX' does not. If you are unable to determine this, please ensure to query the authors for the year of publication._

**Action**:

#### pre-element-cite-string-date

**Warning**: '_XXXXXX' type references must have a year. Reference 'XXXXXX' does not. If you are unable to determine this, please ensure to add an author query asking for the year of publication._

**Action**:

#### final-element-cite-string-date

**Error**: _'XXXXXX' type references must have a year. Reference 'XXXXXX' does not. If you are unable to determine this, please ensure to query the authors for the year of publication._

**Action**:

#### pre-pub-id-test-1

**Warning**: _@xlink:href must start with an http:// or ftp:// protocol. - XXXXXX does not. If this information is missing, please ensure to query it with the authors._

**Action**:

#### final-pub-id-test-1

**Error**: _@xlink:href must start with an http:// or ftp:// protocol. - XXXXXX does not._

**Action**:

#### pre-pub-id-test-2

**Warning**: _pub-id is tagged as a doi, but it is not one - XXXXXX. If this information is missing, please ensure to query it with the authors._

**Action**:

#### final-pub-id-test-2

**Error**: _pub-id is tagged as a doi, but it is not one - XXXXXX_

**Action**:

#### pub-id-test-3

**Error**: _pub-id is tagged as a pmid, but it contains a character\(s\) which is not a digit - XXXXXX_

**Action**:

#### pub-id-doi-test-1

**Error**: _pub-id has a doi link - XXXXXX - but its pub-id-type is XXXXXX instead of doi._

**Action**:

#### pub-id-doi-test-2

**Error**: _pub id has a doi link - XXXXXX - but the identifier is not the doi - 'XXXXXX', which is incorrect. Either the doi link is correct, and the identifier needs changing, or the identifier is correct and needs adding after 'https://doi.org/' in order to create the real doi link._

**Action**:

#### pub-id-test-4

**Warning**: _pub id contains whitespace - XXXXXX - which is very likely to be incorrect._

**Action**:

#### pub-id-test-5

**Error**: _XXXXXX pub-id ends with a full stop - XXXXXX - which is not correct. Please remove the full stop._

**Action**:

#### duplicate-ref-test-1

**Error**: _ref 'XXXXXX' has the same doi as another reference, which is incorrect. Is it a duplicate?_

**Action**:

#### duplicate-ref-test-2

**Warning**: _ref 'XXXXXX' has the same doi as another reference, which might be incorrect. If they are not different chapters from the same book, then this is incorrect._

**Action**:

#### duplicate-ref-test-3

**Warning**: _ref 'XXXXXX' has the same title and source as another reference, which is almost certainly incorrect - 'XXXXXX', 'XXXXXX'._

**Action**:

#### duplicate-ref-test-4

**Warning:** _ref 'XXXXXX' has the same title as another reference, but a different source. Is this correct? - 'XXXXXX'_

**Action:** This warning will appear if two references have the same titles. This may happen if the authors include two separate reference lists which have been collated into one, leaving duplicate references. Check the details of both references and if the information is exactly the same, delete one of the duplicates. If the other details of the references differ \(e.g. year, author list, where the article was published\), then both references should be kept. For example, this warning will fire if the two references below are in the same article. However, as the other details of the references differ, both should be kept in the reference list.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-06-12-at-09.39.52.png)

#### duplicate-ref-test-6

**Error**: _ref 'XXXXXX' has a doi which is the same as the article itself 'XXXXXX' which must be incorrect._

**Action**:

#### pre-ref-link-presence

**Warning**: _'XXXXXX' has no linked citations. Either the reference should be removed or a citation linking to it needs to be added._

**Action**:

#### final-ref-link-presence

**Error**: _'XXXXXX' has no linked citations. Either the reference should be removed or a citation linking to it needs to be added._

**Action**:

#### ref-given-names-test-1

**Warning**: _Given names should always be initialised. Ref 'XXXXXX' contains a given names with a string longer than 4 characters - 'XXXXXX' in XXXXXX. Is this a surname captured as given names? Or a fully spelt out given names?_

**Action**:

#### bssubtilis-ref-article-title-check

**Info**: _ref XXXXXX references an organism - 'B. subtilis' - but there is no italic element with that correct capitalisation or spacing._

**Action**: This is an information message indicating that an organism is mentioned in a reference title without the correct italics, capitalisation or spacing. This is likely the result of reference validation bringing in the details without the ideal formatting \(this formatting may not have been supplied when the article was sent to PubMed or Crossref\). Unless an author complains, no changes are required.
