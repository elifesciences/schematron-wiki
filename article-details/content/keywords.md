# Keywords and research organisms

## What are keywords?

Keywords are one-word (or two) terms that allow articles to be searchable on the journal's website and through online search engines, such as PMC and Google Scholar. These also provide an accurate representation of what the study was about. These should not be confused with research organisms which you can read about [**below**](keywords.md#research-organisms).&#x20;

## Examples of keywords

The words chosen should ideally be specific to the topic of the article, and it is beneficial to include additional words that are not included in the title. &#x20;

Here is an example of keywords for the following article:

**Article title:** On the importance of statistics in molecular simulations for thermodynamics, kinetics and simulation box size

**Subject area:** Structural Biology And Molecular Biophysics

**Keywords:** molecular dynamics, simulation, statistics, thermodynamics, kinetics

Keywords are not visible in the PDF but are included within the XML. These are present at the bottom of the article's webpage, alongside the research category. The eLife website changes these to capitals but in the XML these should be in lowercase as shown above.

## What needs to be checked?

Keywords are decided by the authors and entered into eJP during the submission process.&#x20;

Please check these are:&#x20;

* In lower case only, with the exception of proper nouns
* In italics if appropriate (e.g. _E. coli_)
* For species name the Genus should be reduced to first letter and full stop (eg _Escherichia coli_ should be _E. coli_)
* One-word (or two) terms

In eJP, authors are only allowed to enter a maximum of 6 separate keywords. During proofing, authors may request to add more. If these seem reasonable, this is fine to do but you may wish to run this past Editorial if you are unsure.

Common abbreviations such as DNA, RNA, TNF, TSS etc should not be spelt out. If the author has decided to expand these when entering the keyword into eJP, these should be left as provided.&#x20;

## Research organisms

A research organism can be any creature that the authors used within their study. These can range from bacteria to humans. See below for the preselected list available in eJP but this is not exhaustive and authors may wish to add their own during proofing.

## Schematron checks

### Content checks

**test-auth-kwd-group-presence-2**

**Error**: _XXXXXX articles must not have any author keywords_

**Action**: This will fire if a Correction or Retraction notice contains author keywords. They should be deleted in Kriya.

**test-ro-kwd-group-presence-2**

**Warning**: _XXXXXX does not contain a Research Organism keyword group. Is this correct?_

**Action**: This will fire if any one of the following article types does not contain a research organism keyword - Research Article, Research Advance, Replication Study, Research Communication. Even in the case where no research organisms were used in a work a keyword containing 'None' should be added. Check in eJP if one has been selected (Exeter should check the output from eJP). If not, then add 'None' as a keyword and add the following author query:

* Please confirm whether any research organisms were used for this work.

**kwd-group-title**

**Error**: _kwd-group title is XXXXXX, which is wrong. It should be 'Research organism'._

**Action**: The title for a keyword group containing research organisms (`<kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism">`) should be 'Research organism'. This is boilerplate text, so if this fires it means something has gone awry in Kriya and will need to be correct by Exeter or Exeter's support team.

**kwd-upper-case**

**Error**: _research-organism kwd elements should start with an upper-case letter._

**Action**: Research organism keywords must start with an upper-case letter. If it is a misspelling of one of the set research organisms, then correct it. If it is not a misspelling or it is unclear which one should be used, then Exeter should check with eLife Production who should determine which of the [**set research organism**](keywords.md#list-of-allowed-research-organism) keywords should be used.

**kwd-child-test**

**Error**: _research-organism keywords cannot have child elements such as XXXXXX._

**Action**: This will fire if a research organism keyword has any child element which is not italic. This includes formatting such as bold, superscript etc., but also other XML elements. If the keyword contains disallowed formatting, then remove it or re-key the keyword in Kriya. If it contains other elements, then Exeter will need to fix this.

**auth-kwd-check**

**Warning**: _Keyword - 'XXXXXX' - does not appear in the article text with this capitalisation. Should it be XXXXXX instead?_

**Action**: This will fire if an author keyword is not entirely in lower case, and does not appear in the article with that capitalisation. This may mean that the capitalisation for that keyword is incorrect (that it should perhaps be made entirely lower case). Search the word(s) in the article to see if it is used with different capitalisation, and if it is then update the keyword accordingly. If it doesn't appear in the article, then google it to determine whether it is a proper noun (in which case the capitalisation can be left) or not (in which case it should still be made entirely lower case).

**auth-kwd-check-2**

**Warning**: _Keyword contains what looks like a broken unicode - XXXXXX._

**Action**: This will fire for keywords containing broken unicode such as `&#x03B2;-cell regeneration`. Search the broken unicode text online followed by the word 'unicode' in order to find the correct symbol. In the example above, doing so reveals that the correct letter is Greek small letter Beta, so the keyword should be updated to `Î²-cell regeneration`.

**auth-kwd-check-3**

**Error**: _Keyword contains markup captured as text - XXXXXX. Please remove it and ensure that it is marked up properly (if necessary)._

**Action**: This will fire for keywords containing markup as text such as `<italic>E. coli`. Remove the unnecessary tags and, if necessary, ensure that the keyword is in italics.

**auth-kwd-check-4**

**Warning**: _Keyword contains brackets - XXXXXX.  These should either simply be removed, or added as two keywords (with the brackets still removed)._

**Action**: This will fire if a keyword contains any of the following characters '(', ')', '\[', ']', '{', '}'. If this is a scientific term which contains brackets such as `poly(A)-tail` or `(p)ppGpp` then it can be ignored. Check the rest of the text or search the term online to determine whether it is a common scientific term which contains brackets. If this isn't the case, then any text in the brackets should be added as a separate keyword, and the brackets removed. Quite often these will be terms followed by an abbreviation. For example `electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM)` should be changed to `electron cryo-microscopy`, `cryoEM`.

**auth-kwd-check-5**

**Warning**: _Keyword contains 'and' - XXXXXX. These should be split out into two keywords._

**Action**: This will fire for keywords containing the text ' and ', for example `arbitrary and deliberate decisions`. Keywords should contain a single term, so the presence of 'and' indicates that they need to be split up. In some cases this is as simple as removing the `and` and capturing the text either side as two keywords. For example this keyword `cilia and flagella` can be simply split into two, `cilia`, `flagella`. However in some cases you may need to look at the text and determine how they should be split. For example `arbitrary and deliberate decisions` should be split into `arbitrary decisions`, `deliberate decisions`.

**auth-kwd-check-6**

**Warning**: _Keyword contains more than 4 words - XXXXXX. Should these should be split out into separate keywords?_

**Action**: This will fire for keywords containing more than 4 words in them (it will not fire in feature content). This indicates that the keyword contains a phrase which can be split up. Use your judgement as to whether this can be split up into multiple keywords or not.

**auth-kwd-check-7**

**Warning**: _Keyword contains an organism name which is not in italics - XXXXXX. Please italicise the organism name in the keyword._

**Action**: This will fire for keywords containing unitalicised organism names such as `E.coli`.  These should be italicised, such as _`E.coli`_.

**test-auth-kwd-group-presence-1**

**Error**: _One author keyword group must be present in article-meta._

**Action**: This will fire if more than 1 or no author keyword group element (`<kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords">`) is present in any article which is not a correction or retraction notice. Check the article in eJP (Exeter should check the eJP output) to see if there are any keywords for that article. If there are, then they should be added in. If there are none, then the following author query should be added:

* Please provide keywords for use in PMC and other downstream services.

**non-ro-kwd-presence-test**

**Warning**: _kwd-group must contain at least one kwd_

**Action**: This will fire if there is an author keyword group which contains no actual keywords. Check the article in eJP (Exeter should check the eJP output) to see if there are any keywords for that article. If there are, then they should be added in. If there are none, then the following author query should be added:

* Please provide keywords for use in PMC and other downstream services.

**ro-kwd-presence-test**

**Warning**: _kwd-group must contain at least one kwd_

**Action**: This will fire if there is an author keyword group which contains no actual keywords. Check in eJP if one has been selected (Exeter should check the output from eJP). If not, then add 'None' as a keyword and add the following author query:

* Please confirm whether any research organisms were used for this work.

### XML structure checks

**test-ro-kwd-group-presence-1**

**Error**: _More than 1 Research organism keyword group is present in article-meta. This is incorrect._

**Action**: This will fire if more than one `<kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism">` element is present as a child of `<article-meta>`. If this fires, it means something has gone awry in Kriya and Exeter will need to correct it.

**kwd-group-type**

**Error**: _kwd-group must have a @kwd-group-type 'research-organism', or 'author-keywords'._

**Action**: This will fire if a `<kwd-group>` element does not have a `kwd-group-type` attribute with the value 'research-organism', or 'author-keywords'. If this fires it means something has gone awry in Kriya and Exeter will need to fix it.
