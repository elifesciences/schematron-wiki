  It differs from website and communication house style as it is specific to the
  research articles.

## What is article content house style?

The production vendors work with a lot of different clients and most of them have a house style. Therefore, they request each of their publishers lets them know what their house style is. As an online-only journal, we wanted for each article to be allowed to be a unit in-of itself and for the author not be subject to arbitrary changes to their content dictated by the publisher (in a printed edition it's understandable that publishers would want a consistent feel across the publication). However, authors are inconsistent within their own article and it is hard for vendors to spot this if there is not a set of rules to conform to. Therefore, we created a house style as guidance. This is also useful to indicate where we don't want things to be changed if a copy editor is applying another publisher's rules to our content.

## What needs to be checked?

Nothing needs to be specifically checked by production staff, but the below is the guidance for vendor staff and where possible Schematron rules have been created to help guide them.

#### Article title

This should be one sentence without colons and em dashes. Exceptions: Colons are allowed for...

Sentence case should be used (ie only the first letter of the first word is capitalised). Exceptions: proper nouns and genuses



## Schematron checks

### Content checks

These checks relate to the content of \[insert name of page]. X or XXXXXX refers to quoted text which will change depending on the article.

**article-title-test-1**

**Error**: _Article title must not end with a full stop - 'XXXXXX'._

**Action**: A title cannot end with a fullstop. Please remove the fullstop from the title.

**article-title-test-2**

**Warning**: _Article title is entirely in lower case, is this correct? - XXXXXX._

**Action**: It is very unusual for a title to start with a lower case letter. It is possible if, for instance, if a title begins with 'acyl carrier protein (ACP)' the A in acyl should not be capitalised.

**article-title-test-3**

**Error**: _Article title must not be entirely in upper case - XXXXXX._

**Action**: We use sentence case so during preediting any manuscript submitted that uses all caps for the title should be changed to sentence case. Update this if this has not been done by the typesetter.

**article-title-test-5**

**Warning**: _Article title contains maths. Is this correct?_

**Action**: Downstream services that receive eLife metadata usually cannot process MathML so we avoid using it in the title. Usually, if a title contains MathML characters these can be replaced with normal font special character.

**article-title-test-6**

**Error**: _Article title must not contain bold._

**Action**: Bold font is not allowed in titles. Please convert to Roman.

**article-title-test-7**

**Error**: _Article title must not contain underline._

**Action**: Underlined text is not allowed in a title. Please remove the underlining

**article-title-test-9**

**Error**: _Article title contains the string '-Based '. this should be lower-case, '-based '. - XXXXXX_

**Action**:

**article-title-test-10**

**Warning**: _Article title contains a colon. This almost never allowed. - XXXXXX_

**Action**:

**article-title-test-11**

**Warning**: _Article title contains a capitalised word(s) which is not capitalised in the body of the article - XXXXXX - is this correct? - XXXXXX_

**Action**:

### XML structure checks

These checks relate to the XML structure of \[insert name of page]. â€ŒX or XXXXXX refers to quoted text which will change depending on the article. For more information about what the XML should look like, see below (include link to XML structure).

#### **covid-processing-instruction**

**Warning**: _The article title (XXXXXX) suggests that this article should probably have the covid processing instruction - '_\<?covid-19-tdm?>_' - but it does not. Should it?_

**Action**: If this article relates to covid-19 there should be a special processing instruction in the XML. This is not in the content and is not viewable on Kriya, PDF or eLife website, it is purely for delivery to PMC so they can identify and group relevant papers on their site. If it is missing you will need to ask the typesetter to fix this and add it.

#### **test-title-group-presence**

**Error**: _title-group containing article-title must be present._

**Action**: Within the XML the article title must be contained within a \<title-group>. If it is not, it will need to be sent back to ask the typesetter to fix this. An example of how the XML should look is below:

```
<title-group>
    <article-title>The eLife research article</article-title>
</title-group>
```

****

**article-title-test-4**

**Error**: _Article title must not be empty._

**Action**: The article-title in the XML is empty. This is a mistake and the title has either been accidentally processed into another field or is missing. You can add the title in using the Kriya interface (and remove it from elsewhere if placed there by accident).

**article-title-test-8**

**Error**: _Article title must not contain a line break (the element 'break')._

**Action**: If the XML contains a line break in the title this needs to be removed. You can do this by removing the space between the words in the Kriya interface and then creating a space again using the space bar.

****

**article-title-test-12**

**Warning**: _Article title contains the string ' based'. Should the preceding space be replaced by a hyphen - '-based'. - XXXXXX_

**Action**:

Include an example of the xml with variations if appropriate.
