# Interacting with authors

Most of our interaction with the authors of eLife articles happens via email. It is important to ensure that queries from authors are responded to the day they are received, unless after 4pm, in which case they can be replied to the following morning. If we do not have an answer to the queries yet, the authors should be made aware that we are looking into it. There are many email templates saved in the production collaboration tool \(Hiver\) which are useful for drafting responses - but these should be tailored to cover the nuances in each author query. To access the Hiver templates, open an email and click to reply to it, then click on the 'Email templates' button. Select the appropriate template and tailor it to the email.

## Common queries 

Most of the emails we get from authors fall into the following categories:

### Adding ORCIDs

Often authors will ask for ORCIDs to be added to manuscripts on behalf of other authors. Unfortunately, due to ORCIDs stipulations, we cannot do this. The only way for an ORCID to be linked to a manuscript is for the author in question to access the proofs using the link we send them. There is an [**email template**](interacting-with-authors.md#orcid-addition) with this information, which will need to be edited depending on what stage the proofs are at.

### Corrections and new versions

Some emails will be from authors who have noticed a mistake or problem in their published article. If the error affects the scientific conclusions of the article, a correction will need to be prepared \(this needs to be checked with the editorial team first\). If there are errors in non-scientific content \(e.g. affiliations, spelling of author names, author contributions\), a new version can be issued. Check the article to see what the problem is and if the error is due to eLife mistakes, make sure to apologise, and let the author know this will be updated as soon as possible. Once a new version has been published, let the author know.

### Extensions to proofing deadline

The initial email authors receive when their proofs are ready to review asks for them to return these proofs within two working days. A reminder email will then be sent after 2, and then 4 days. However, authors can extend their proofing time if needed. If authors email to ask for extra time to proof their article, we need to let them know that they may still receive the automatic reminder emails, and that these should be ignored in the meantime. Once you have sent this, make sure to leave a comment in the note for the article in Kriya so staff know that the article will be delayed.

### Problems editing proofs

Often authors will email because they are unable to make changes to their proofs. This may be because they are using the wrong browser or there is a bug in the system. If possible, try to instruct the authors on how they can make the changes themselves, with screenshots if appropriate \(e.g. how to respond to queries so they can progress to the next tab in the proofs\). 

If the changes are few and straightforward enough \(e.g. fixing a typo or adding a figure citation\), you can jump in and fix these for the author. Select the 'publisher check' option on the Kriya dashboard and access the proofs this way. If the authors are logged in, you will need to ask them to log out. Otherwise, you can list the changes in the notes of the article for Exeter or eLife to address once the authors return the proofs. 

If the changes are extensive, the authors should be encouraged to make the edits in the system where possible \(e.g. changes to the text\). If the authors are still unwilling to do this \(but the system is working fine\), we will need to make the changes for them. If the authors cannot make the changes because of problems with the system, the email should be forwarded on to Exeter with the subject prefix 'Author correspondence: XXXXX' \(where XXXXX is the article number\) so they can make the changes at the post-author validation stage \(see more about tagging and prefixing emails [**here**](managing-the-production-inbox.md#tags-and-prefixes)\). Make sure the author knows which course of action you are taking.

### Problems accessing proofs

If authors have problems accessing their proofs, make sure they are using Google Chrome and if there are still issues, ask for a screenshot of what they see when they try to log in. We also need to ask the authors the version and name of their operating system name and the version of the browser they are using. This information can then be forwarded on to Exeter to investigate. 

### Press

Authors may email to let us know their institutions are preparing a press release. Our press officer, Emily, should be cc'd into these emails and the authors should be told that they can co-ordinate a release date with her. There is an [**email template**](interacting-with-authors.md#press-information) for this. 

### Proof/publication date estimation

If authors want to know when they will receive their proofs, or when their article will be published, we need to first check what stage the article is at. 

* If an article has recently been added to Kriya and it is only waiting for its decision letter, it will usually take around a week before this is ready to go to the authors. 
* If an article is waiting for a digest, check the [**digest status list**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Llag-aEnbuARu5ORDJFki4K73xzy1fz2B2XG_QHQPI/edit#gid=1376331906) to see when this will be ready. The proofs will automatically be sent to the authors once this is uploaded by the Features team. Usually decision letters will be added before the digests are ready.
* Once an article has arrived at publisher review, it should be ready to publish on the same day, unless there are issues to correct or the authors want to see revised proofs \(or the article is getting press coverage, in which case it should be scheduled for a pre-agreed press date\).

### Revised proof requests

Often authors will ask to see their proofs again once any issues they noticed have been fixed. Let them know we will be in touch with revised proofs in due course. Unless the authors have had serious problems with using the Kriya interface, proofs should be sent back to the authors in the system instead of sending revised PDFs. This just gives us more complete data about the time each article spends at each stage.

### Updated figures or files

Often authors will respond to the proofing email they get to let us know any issues they face with the system, or to send us updated figures and supplementary files that we have asked for. Download these files and compress them in a zip folder. You can then attach this in the note for the corresponding article on the Kriya dashboard, and ask Exeter to update the files. [**See here**](../pages-in-progress/kriya-1.md#adding-notes) for instructions on adding notes to articles. 

After doing this, let the authors know that the files will be updated in the final version of their article. If the authors have not submitted the proofs back to Production let them know that they will need to do this before the files can be replaced \(there is an [**email template**](interacting-with-authors.md#author-to-sign-off-before-changes-can-be-made) for this\). 

### Striking images

Striking images are requested in the acceptance email that is sent to authors. However, the article may be exported to Kriya before they respond, so authors will often send the striking images directly to production. For guidance on what to do with these, [**see here**](). Once you have uploaded striking images, make sure to let the author know you have done this \(there is an [**email template**](interacting-with-authors.md#striking-image-response) for this\). 

## Hiver templates

The following templates are saved in Hiver:

#### Author delay response

This can be used to reply to authors who indicate they will be delayed in returning their proofs. 

#### Author to sign off before changes can be made

This can be used when authors provide updated figures to replace in their proofs and the proofs are still with them.

#### Chaser

This can be used to check in with authors who still haven't returned their proofs after receiving the 4-day reminder email.

#### Cover image response

This can be used to reply to authors who are unclear about the difference between eLife's cover images and striking images. Often the expectation is that the striking image they provided will be used to generate the cover poster they can download when their article is published but the cover images we use are specific to each major subject area and at present cannot be personalised to each article. 

#### COVID Chaser

As above, but this is being used during the COVID pandemic.

#### Features update

This is a template email for sending the features update email to the features team.

#### Figure size requirements

This template includes information about eLife's figure size requirements

#### Happy author reply

This can be used in response to authors who thank us once their article is published. 

#### Hold for Insight

This can be used when an article is ready to publish but it has an Insight which is not ready yet. You will need to fill in information about when the Insight is expected to be published \(check with the features team\).

#### LaTex Package request

This template is used when authors have used LaTex packages that are not amongst those on Exeter's system, and these packages have not been provided as supporting files on the submission system. This means that the article file cannot be properly processed. When this happens, a list of the missing packages will be provided and this should be passed on to the author using this email. Once the missing packagaes/supporting files have been provided, these should be passed on to Exeter.

#### ORCID addition

This can be used when authors ask us to add ORCIDs for them. It is ORCIDs stipulation that authors add this themselves. If the proofs are already back with us, ask the authors whether they would like us to send them a revised link so they can add the ORCIDs. 

#### Press information

This template includes information about eLife's press policy

#### Revised article and figures PDFs

This should be sent to authors when attaching revised article and figures PDFs. This should only be used if the authors had issues accessing the proofs in Kriya. 

#### Second proof

This can be used when second proofs have been requested by the authors and you need to convey further information that is not included in the proofing email.

#### Striking image info

This template contains information about the striking image requirements.

#### Striking image response

This can be used when authors send us striking images to upload.

#### Summer Fridays response

This is a template email for Prepress to use when the production team are out of office for Summer Fridays.
