# PDF template

## What is the PDF template?

The PDF is built from the underlying XML and is one of the main outputs of the production process. It is a typeset version of the article, which means it is easily recognisable as an eLife article. Many authors still consider this the only output of their journal article, despite the effort we put into the underlying XML so it is machine-readable and can be sent in XML format to many different places, including the eLife website.

## What are the features of the eLife research article template?

### Running heads

These are the headers on the page, above the content. They are built from key metadata in the XML.

#### First page running heads

**First page left**: This is the eLife logo, which should be a clickable link that takes the reader to the eLife homepage: [https://elifesciences.org/](https://elifesciences.org)

**First page right**: This contains the article type in all caps (e.g. RESEARCH ARTICLE) followed by a pipe symbol. Next is the open access unlocked logo, which is a clickable link to: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access). This is followed by another pipe and then the CC logo, which is a clickable link to creative commons ([https://creativecommons.org/](https://creativecommons.org)). Creative commons is the home of the licenses we apply to eLife content.

#### Follow on pages running heads

On the follow-on pages the headers change, but remain the same for all follow on pages of the PDF for a single article.

* **Follow-on page left**: This is a standardised eLife "logo" followed by the article type, in this case 'Research article". Sentence case is used for this text
* **Follow-on page right**: The major subject area(s) in blue colour. If there is more than one major subject area they are seperated using a pipe symbol.
