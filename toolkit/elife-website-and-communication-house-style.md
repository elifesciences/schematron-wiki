**Maintenance procedure**\
****@channel in slack channel #styleguide if you want to ask a question, add content, or suggest change \
Production team staff will make any approved changes to this page and add change history

### **Sentence case/all caps**

General notes:

* eLife is _never_ Elife or ELife
* Title case should be used for eLife-branded terms, for example, eLife Lens and eLife Labs (note: eLife digest is not an eLife extension brand so the “d” of digest is not capitalised)
* Book titles should always be in title case (and italicised)

The definition of proper nouns has been extended. The following items are now proper nouns in eLife style (apply title case):

* Article type (e.g. Research Article, Feature Article, Point of View)
* Major subject area/research category (e.g. Microbiology and Infectious Disease)
* Research organism (e.g. Rat, Mouse, Human, Zebrafish)
* Titles (e.g. Senior Editor, Deputy Editor, Head of Marketing and Communications. Note: ‘editors’ is a generic term and not a proper noun so remains lower case unless starting a sentence.)
* Early-Career Advisory Group
* Google Hangout on Air
* Author Guide and Policies
* Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology
* The Natural History of Model Organisms
* Executable Research Article

For information, the following are not proper nouns: editors, early-careers researchers, eLife-sponsored presentation series, materials and methods and discussion.\
****

Exceptions to sentence case rule:

* Sub-title before the colon should be capital case and first letter of first word after colon should be capital: eg:&#x20;
  * Media Coverage: Nothing fishy…
  * Point of View: Strategies from UW-Madison for rescuing biomedical research in the US
  * Webinar Report: Removing barriers for women in science

**Note for product team**

The research organism ‘tag’ on the HTML page could be a different colour from author keywords. It should also appear above the author keywords in the list.

All XML is provided in sentence/title case, but any display of ALL CAPS is a design feature of the website and thus not covered in this house-style document.

### **Italics**

Where to use and not to use italics:

* Italicise book titles
* Journal/periodical titles – do not italicise in text but italicise in the reference list at the end of an article
* Magazine/newspaper/website title – do not italicise in text but italicise in the reference list at the end of an article
* Do not italicise et al.
* Always italicise genus and species
* Do not italicise Latin terms (e.g. in vitro)

### **Oxford comma**

Use common sense. For example, in a list of one-word items, don’t use an Oxford comma, but if the list is more complicated then do use it. However, don’t be afraid to swap the comma for a semi-colon if the list is really complicated and this would aid readability.

### **Full stops**

In general minimal use of full stops is preferred, for instance, if a ‘blurb’ is a single sentence no full stop is required at the end. However, see below for exceptions.

Specific examples:

* Full stops are used at the end of impact statements
* No full stops at the end of a title, header style or hero image
* Use full stops to separate letters in e.g., i.e., i.v., and so on
* Do not use full stops to separate out the letters of etc. but add full stop to end

### **Hyphens/en rules**

When to use hyphens (dashes):

* Compound words, for example, user-friendly and six-year-old, open-source technology, open-access publishing

When to use en-rules:

* Relationships thought of as parallel, symmetric, equal, oppositional or at least involving separate or independent elements, for example, Mann–Whitney U test.
* When introducing a new clause in a sentence, never use a hyphen or a double hyphen, always use an en rule. There should be a space on either side of the en rule, for example, Peter, Melissa and Andy – the house style gurus – think this is the right way forward. It is personal choice whether to use en rules or brackets for this.
* Use en rules for ranges, but there are no spaces on either side of the en rule, for example, 12–15 March 2014, 15–20mg.

When not to use either:

* In titles (e.g. Press package: Cells sell sunscreen)
* For ‘postdoc’

**Note:** how to add an en-rule using HTML:&#x20;

* \&#8211;
* See: http://www.ascii.cl/htmlcodes.htm

### **Colons**

Use colons rather than en rules in titles, for example:&#x20;

* Media coverage: Nothing fishy…
* Press package: Cells sell sunscreen

### **Ampersand (&)**

Do not use.

Exceptions:

* Book/journal/article title that is registered with “&” and so is the official title
* Direct quotations where the original source used an ampersand

**Note for product team**

Where & is used on the eLife website and could be changed:

* Article & author info
* Figures & data
* Categories & tags

### **Date format**

US style – March 16, 2015.

or

Monday March 16, 2015

or

Monday, March 16

### Time format

12 hour clock – 7am or 7pm.

Time zones should be included where appropriate e.g. 7pm EST

When referring to a time period use an en rule e.g. 7pm–8pm

With minutes e.g. 7.30am

### **Peoples’ names**

* Use first name and surname unless within a research article, in a research article just use surname
* After first use of a person’s full name refer to them using their surname
* In reference lists; surname followed by initials

### **US/UK spelling**

UK spelling is used on the eLife website, except use US date format.

Within journal content the style is determined by the author; as long as it is consistently used, either US or UK spelling is acceptable.

### **Numbers**

Spell out one to nine unless displayed with a unit. Numbers 10 and above should always be numerals unless starting a sentence. If starting a sentence with a number, try to re-word if possible.

Specific points:

* Ranges are separated by an en rule
* Add comma separations to large numbers, for example, 1,000
* For large numbers, such as million and billion, abbreviate to m and bn, respectively (e.g. 1m and 1.5bn)
* Numbers and their units should be closed up, for example, 20mg, 5s, 4h

### **Telephone numbers**

For US phone numbers, use the following format: (541) 754-3010

### **Bulleted list**

Use bullets not dashes or other symbols.

Exception: if it is necessary to number the items in a list, for example:

1. Mix the eggs
2. Add the flour
3. Wait 10 min
4. Put in the oven

Punctuation should be consistent across a list, ideally across the article.

Preference is for no punctuation per item and to start each bullet with upper case letter, but use common sense.

### **Z spellings**

Follow Microsoft Word spell check, with the dictionary set on UK language.

### **Quotations and quotation marks**

Use single quotations for emphasis and double for a direct quotation.

Example of emphasis: I thought this was meant to be a ‘simple’ style guide!

Regarding punctuation and quotations, punctuation marks belong within the quotations if text is a full sentence, and outside if not, for example:

The eLife design is “beautiful and user-friendly”.&#x20;

Eve Marder said, “Why do we have to have a house style anyway?”.

### **References**&#x20;

Non-paginated journal article (e.g. eLife):

* Hernandez-Nunez L, Belina J, Klein M, Si G, Claus L, Carlson JR, Samuel AD. 2015. Reverse correlation analysis of navigation dynamics in Drosophila larva using optogenetics. eLife 4:e06225. doi: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06225.

Paginated journal article:

* Allred DM. 1952. Plague important fleas and mammals in Utah and the western United States. The Great Basin Naturalist 12:67–75.
* Arbogast P, Glösmann M, Peichl L. 2013. Retinal cone photoreceptors of the deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus: development, topography, opsin expression and spectral tuning. PLOS ONE 8:1–12. doi: [**https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054583**](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054583).

Book:

* Baird SF. 1859. Mammals of North America. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott & Co
* Baker RH. 1968. Habitats and distribution. In: King JA, editor. Biology of Peromyscus (Rodentia). New York: American Society of Mammalogists.

The minimal information that can be given for a reader to locate an article is as follows (this would not be sufficient in a reference list, but is satisfactory for simplicity on the web pages, especially if a clickable link):

* Cite as: eLife 2015;4:e08715.

### **Abbreviations**

Abbreviations can be used, as long as defined first.&#x20;

Use discretion:

* Overuse of abbreviations can make text hard to follow
* No need to define really common abbreviations, for example, DNA

Exceptions:

* e.g., i.e. and etc can be used within parentheses (brackets) without definition. However, if used within main text always spell out.

### **Genus/species/protein**

A species cannot be mentioned without it Genus prefix. At first mention the genus should be spelt out, thereafter contract the genus to first letter followed by a full stop, for example, “_Escherichia coli_ is a commonly known bacteria in the general press. _E. coli_ is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium.”

Gene names are italicized, proteins are not (follow the research article you are referring to as it is often tricky to distinguish between a gene name and its corresponding protein).

### **Other**

* Data are, datum is
* Do not separate sentences with double spaces
