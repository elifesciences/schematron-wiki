# New Starter Guide

Welcome to the production team! This page will outline general resources to help you get settled in at eLife and get to grips with some production-specific processes.&#x20;

### Resources

### Members of staff&#x20;

#### Roles within the production team&#x20;

* Head of Production Operations&#x20;
* Production Editor&#x20;
* Production Assistant&#x20;

#### External staff

* Exeter - This is a production vendor (based in India) who are the content-processors for all eLife articles. They typeset and copy-edit our articles for us, and manage Kriya, the publishing platform we use.
* Freelance staff - We occasionally have the help of freelance staff to complete publisher reviews and to carry out copyediting.&#x20;

#### Meeting other eLife staff members&#x20;

One way to learn about the other departments is to arrange meetings with the other teams who will give you a run through of their day-to-day roles and how production fits into this. It may be helpful to schedule these meetings with the following teams: Editorial, Features, Press, MarComms, Product Devs. Other ways to meet staff members include Donut and Friyay.&#x20;

* Donut: This is a Slack-based web app that allows you to meet other employees for a virtual coffee. It randomly assigns you to someone every fortnight. To join, you will need to be added to the #virtual-coffee Slack channel.&#x20;
* Friyay: This is a (currently virtual) get-together post 4.30pm that happens most Fridays over Zoom. This is arranged on the #friyay Slack channel.&#x20;

### Weekly schedule (core meetings)&#x20;

* Daily Huddles - This gives you the chance to check in with the rest of the team at the start of your working day. You may want to troubleshoot with the team about any articles or correspondence with authors, discuss planned leave, and prioritise for the day.&#x20;
* Monday: Production/Editorial Meeting&#x20;
* Tuesday and Wednesday: Weekly call with Exeter&#x20;
* Wednesday: eLife Staff Meeting (fortnightly)&#x20;
* Thursday: Production Team Meeting&#x20;
* Weekly updates with your line manager&#x20;

### Key pieces of software

If you need help installing any of this software, or wish to have some training on how best to use these, get in contact with your manager in the first instance who can advice you who best to talk to.&#x20;

* Kriya - The cloud-based publishing platform that eLife uses. The production team and authors use this system to edit and review their article following typesetting and copyediting by Exeter.
* Slack - This is used throughout eLife to communicate via channels focused on topics, as private groups, and via direct messages.&#x20;
* Time trackers: Toggl and Task Adept&#x20;

### Equipment&#x20;

If you need a particular piece of hardware - such as a keyboard or mouse, you will need to get in touch with our Office and HR Manager, Lena. She will arrange a meeting with you to discuss what equipment eLife could provide you to suit your individual needs.&#x20;
